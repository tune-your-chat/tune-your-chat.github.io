summary: /tokenrefresh can only be called once so is vulnerable to failure

  There is a problem if client sends the POST for a {{/tokenrefresh}} but for some reason does not receive the response; this leaves the client without a valid {{refresh_token}}.

  Proposed solution is to allow (or better, require) the client to pass a client-generated secret. The HS should then allow re-use of the refresh token, provided the returned {{access_token}} / {{refresh_token}} have not been used since.

  Alternative solution might be to not actually expire the {{refresh_token}} on successful {{/tokenrefresh}}, but instead to wait until the returned {{access_token}} / {{refresh_token}} are used.

  body: We've decided to remove refresh tokens from the matrix spec (see https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/395), so this is no longer required.
