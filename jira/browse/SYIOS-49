  * 1:1 private chats seem to be named after yourself, not the person you're talking to
   * If there are only 2 people in a public room, the name of one of the participants seems to take priority over naming the room than its actual alias or topic.  e.g. #openwebrtc:matrix.org is shown as "Stefan Test" as the display name.

  Meanwhile, #testing:matrix.org appears to only have 2 users rather than the >10 it really has, and claims to be called "Matthew" :/

    There was a previous issue where the room name was hard written instead of letting the application displaying the name of the other member

    -> #openwebrtc:matrix.org is properly displayed on my side.
    The public room names are not updated with the member except if there is an issue with the public/private status.

    ->#testing:matrix.org has 2 users (You and myself) + 1 left user (matael).
    It really looks like  the room public statuses are corrupted.

    This issue is already fixed on develop.
    Unfortunately wrong room name may still appear if someone uses iOS console build from master (for example: build #44).
