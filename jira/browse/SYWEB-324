  1. I have a chat with Brennan open
  2. I go to Brennan’s profile and click »start chat« again
  3. A new separate chat with Brennan opens

  This is very confusing. Instead, the existing chat with that person should be opened. Otherwise you have two separate conversations with the same person – one might write in the first, the other in the second.
