  * Set up a user with one client connected in a room where you can see their presence. Client event stream timeout is 30s.
   * Connect the client
   > Observe presence goes to online
   * Cleanly shut down client
   > Observe presence goes to offline
   * Start up client
   > Presence goes online again
   * Uncleanly terminate client
   > Presence stays online for over 5 minutes (seems to go offline again after a few more minutes)

  Expected: Presence should go back to being offline after a couple of minutes at most (which would be 4x the event stream timeout). Probably more like 40 or 60s.
