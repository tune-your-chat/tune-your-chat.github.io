                <p>Hi folks. As previously mentioned on <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/bridges-security-updates/">Monday</a>, we’re now disclosing the vulnerabilities patched for the IRC, Slack and Hookshot bridges. If you have not already done so, please ensure you are running the patched versions.</p>
<p>Today we are disclosing the 3 vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-bridge-doesn-t-verify-the-sub-parameter-of-an-openid-token-exchange-cve-2023-38691">matrix-appservice-bridge doesn't verify the sub parameter of an openId token exchange (CVE-2023-38691)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x">GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38691">CVE-2023-38691</a></p>
<p>The <code>POST /v1/exchange_openid</code> endpoint did not check that the servername part of the <code>sub</code> parameter (containing the user's <em>claimed</em> MXID) is the same as the servername we are talking to. This could allow a malicious actor to spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a <code>sub</code> parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.</p>
<p>This is now patched so that the server part of the sub / user ID is checked against the server used to make the request.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by a community member.</p>
<h2 id="irc-command-injection-via-admin-commands-containing-newlines-cve-2023-38690">IRC command injection via admin commands containing newlines (CVE-2023-38690)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3">GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38690">CVE-2023-38690</a></p>
<p>When the IRC bridge attempted to parse an admin command from a Matrix user, it would only split arguments by a literal space. For example, sending “!join #matrix\nfoobar” would treat the channel name as “#matrix\nfoobar”. This could then be exploited to inject any IRC command into the bridge to be run. Since the !join command first joins via the bridge bot user, it could be used to execute commands as the bridge bot.</p>
<p>This is now patched so that both the command handler is more strict about its arguments, as well as channel names being explicitly validated when provided by users.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a>.</p>
<h2 id="events-can-be-crafted-to-leak-parts-of-targeted-messages-from-other-bridged-rooms-cve-2023-38700">Events can be crafted to leak parts of targeted messages from other bridged rooms (CVE-2023-38700)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q">GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38700">CVE-2023-38700</a></p>
<p>The IRC bridge caches recent timeline messages in memory, so that when a reply is seen for a message it doesn’t need to request the event content from the homeserver. However the room ID was not validated when accessing this cache, so a malicious actor could craft a reply event in another room referencing any event ID (so long as it was still in the bridge cache) to trick the bridge into posting the message content into a bridged reply.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a>.</p>

                <p>Today we are announcing security updates for several of our bridges.</p>
<ul>
<li>matrix-appservice-irc <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.1">1.0.1</a> affected by GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38691">CVE-2023-38691</a>, GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3 / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38690">CVE-2023-38690</a>, and GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q</li>
<li>matrix-hookshot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/4.4.1">4.4.1</a> affected by GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38691">CVE-2023-38691</a></li>
<li>matrix-appservice-slack <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/2.1.2">2.1.2</a> affected by GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38691">CVE-2023-38691</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition we have released matrix-appservice-bridge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/9.0.1">9.0.1</a> (and backported to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/8.1.2">8.1.2</a>) which patches GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x.</p>
<p>All mentioned bridges are affected by a vulnerability in the provisioning interfaces of these bridges. If you are unable to upgrade, please disable provisioning for now (which should be documented in the relevant bridge sample config).</p>

                <p>We have recently announced that <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/deportalling-libera-chat/">we will be honouring Libera Chat’s request</a> to turn off portalled rooms on the Libera.Chat bridge maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The changes were originally scheduled to be effective on 31st July. In the meantime, we posted <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/make-sure-libera-bridge-keeps-working/">instructions for people to turn their portalled rooms into plumbed ones</a> so the bridge keeps working for them.</p>
<p>Some stability issues on the bridge have prevented people from turning their portalled rooms into plumbed ones. We have been actively working on resolving those issues since the first reports and the situation is gradually improving. However, at this point, we do not believe the plumbed mode can be considered sufficiently stable yet.</p>

                <p>Today we are retroactively publishing advisories for security bugs in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a>. From oldest to most recent, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-p9qp-c452-f9r7">GHSA-p9qp-c452-f9r7</a> (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-39374">CVE-2022-39374</a>), fixed in Synapse 1.68.0 and affecting all prior versions since Synapse 1.62.0;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-45cj-f97f-ggwv">GHSA-45cj-f97f-ggwv</a> (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-39335">CVE-2022-39335</a>), fixed in Synapse 1.69.0 and affecting all prior versions; and finally</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr">GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr</a> (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-32323">CVE-2023-32323</a>), fixed in Synapse 1.74.0 and affecting all prior versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly advise Synapse operators who are still on earlier Synapse versions to upgrade to the latest version (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.84.0">v1.84.0</a>) or at the very least v1.74.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.74.0">released Dec 2022</a>), to prevent attacks based on these vulnerabilities. Please see the advisories for the full details, including a description of</p>
<ul>
<li>the vulnerability and potential attacks,</li>
<li>exactly which deployments are vulnerable, and</li>
<li>workarounds and mitigations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these bugs are either related to or exploitable over Matrix federation, we have delayed publishing these advisories until now out of caution. This allowed us to ensure that the majority of Synapse homeservers across the public federation have upgraded to a sufficiently patched version, based on the (opt-in) <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">stats reporting</a> to the Matrix.org foundation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this announcement or any of the advisories, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>

                <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a pair of High severity vulnerabilities
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28427">CVE-2023-28427</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr">GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr</a>
for matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28103">CVE-2023-28103</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv">GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv</a>
for matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients should follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The issues involve prototype pollution via events containing special strings in
key locations, which can temporarily disrupt normal functioning of
matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely.</p>
<p>Although we have only demonstrated a denial-of-service-style impact, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of a more severe impact due to the
relatively extensive attack surface. We have therefore classified this as High
severity and strongly recommend upgrading as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>We found these issues during a codebase audit that we had <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/31/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-19-4-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-53-0">previously
announced</a>
in an earlier security release of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk. The
earlier release had already addressed a set of similar vulnerabilities that
were assigned
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32">GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32</a>
and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr">GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr</a>,
which we had initially decided not to disclose until the completion of the
audit. Now that the audit is finished, we are disclosing those previous
advisories as well.</p>

                <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in
the SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im
and any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or
matrix-android-sdk2.</li>
<li>These have now been fixed, and we have not seen evidence of them being
exploited in the wild. All of the critical vulnerabilities require
cooperation from a malicious homeserver to be exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Please upgrade immediately in order to be protected against these
vulnerabilities.</strong></li>
<li>Clients with other encryption implementations (including Hydrogen, ElementX,
Nheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks and Pantalaimon) are not affected;
<strong>this is not a protocol bug</strong>.</li>
<li>We take the security of our end-to-end encryption extremely seriously, and we
have an ongoing series of public independent audits booked to help guard
against future vulnerabilities.  We will also be making some protocol changes
in the future to provide additional layers of protection.</li>
<li>This resolves the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients">pre-disclosure</a> issued on September 23rd.</li>

                <p>We will be releasing a security update to matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 and clients which implement end-to-end encryption with these libraries, to patch <strong>critical</strong> security issues, on <strong>Wed, Sept 28th</strong>. The releases will be published in the afternoon, followed by the disclosure blog post around 16:00 UTC. The affected clients include Element Web, Desktop, iOS and Android.  We will also be working with downstream packagers and forks over the coming days to ensure a synchronised release to address affected clients.</p>
<p>Clients using matrix-rust-sdk, hydrogen-sdk and matrix-nio are not affected by these critical issues.  We are also auditing third-party client SDKs and clients in advance of the release, and will work with the projects if action is needed. So far we've confirmed that other popular SDK/clients including mtxclient (nheko), Matrix Dart SDK (FluffyChat), Trixnity (Timmy), Syphon, mautrix-go (Gomuks) and mautrix-python are not affected by the issues in question.</p>
<p>If you maintain or package a (potentially) affected E2EE-capable Matrix client and need to coordinate on the release, please contact <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We advise to upgrade as soon as possible after the patched versions are released.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>The details of the final vulnerability will be released at a later date,
pending an audit of the codebase to ensure it's not affected by other similar
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities have been patched in node-irc version 1.3.0 and
matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. You can get the release on
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the
Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.</p>
<p><strong>Please upgrade your IRC bridge as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p>The above vulnerabilities were reported by <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val
Lorentz</a>. Thank you!</p>

                <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a couple of High severity vulnerabilities (reserved as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
for the matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
for the matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients will follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities give an adversary who you share a room with the ability to
carry out a denial-of-service attack against the affected clients, making it
not show all of a user's rooms or spaces and/or causing minor temporary
corruption.</p>
<p>The full vulnerability details will be disclosed at a later date, to give
people time to upgrade and us to perform a more thorough audit of the codebase.</p>
<p>Note that while the vulnerability was to our knowledge never exploited
maliciously, some unintentional public testing has left some people affected by
the bug. We made a best effort to sanitize this to stop the breakage. If you
are affected, you may still need to clear the cache and reload your Matrix
client for it to take effect.</p>
<p>We thank <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a> who discovered and
reported the vulnerability over the weekend.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today we're exceptionally releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.1">Synapse
1.61.1</a>, which comes
as a security release. <strong>Server administrators are encouraged to update as soon as
possible.</strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a vulnerability with Synapse's URL preview feature. URL
previews of some web pages can lead to unbounded recursion, causing the request
to either fail, or in some cases crash the running Synapse process.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the <code>url_preview_enabled</code> configuration option set to <code>false</code>
(the default value) are unaffected. Instances with the <code>enable_media_repo</code>
configuration option set to <code>false</code> are also unaffected, as this also disables
the URL preview functionality.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are unable to update Synapse should disable URL
previews by setting <code>url_preview_enabled: false</code> in their configuration file.
They can also delegate URL preview to a separate, dedicated worker to ensure the
process crashing does not impact other functionality of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32">this security
advisory</a>
