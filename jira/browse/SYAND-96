  Currently by default new installations of Synapse generate and use self-signed SSL certificates.  This works when using the web client since browsers will ask the user whether they should trust a certificate. IOS supports this as it allows you to import certificates.

  Possible solutions:

  * -Import using CADroid- this doesn't work apparently. Trying: https://coderwall.com/p/wv6fpq/add-self-signed-ssl-certificate-to-android-for-browsing
  * -See if accepting the certificate in a browser on the phone propagates to the app.-
  * Add support in the app to import certificates for that connection (https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html#SelfSigned ) 
  * Add support in the app to turn off certificate checking.
  * Add support in the app for prompting a user if they want to trust the server certificate returned by the server (displaying the fingerprints)

  I do not know which of those options a) work and b) are feasible.

    An amusing way of solving this would be to have the homeserver output a QR code with the URL and SSL fingerprint, and then have the android app consume the QR code to automatically connect.

    Ooooh, we could also have the QR codes include a one time key to log into the account!

    I played around with certificate generation and created following script.

    It creates a CA certificate with the "CA:true" constraint, allowing android to import the certificate.

    The important part is "-extensions v3_ca" while creating the CA

  body: Presumably we could have synapse autogenerate its self-signed keys with the CA:true constraint turned on already?

  body: 'By @kegan:matrix.org: there is no reason why we cannot make the app ask for a .crt from the device storage. Alternatively, we may be able to automatically add the key by hitting the hs url (after a user prompt with fingerprint) to avoid intermediary files. How sensibly that can be done I dont know.'
