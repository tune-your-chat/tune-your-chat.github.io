summary: We need to decide whether we expect users to have a local working copy of the source or not.

  Currently the README.rst guides you through installing Synapse directly via pip via:

  {code}
  pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master
  {code}

  Meanwhile, other instructions like UPGRADE.rst assume that you have a local git working copy of the source which you can do things like:

  {code}
  To pull in new dependencies, run::

      python setup.py develop --user

  This update includes a change to the database schema. To upgrade you first need
  to upgrade the database by running::

      python scripts/upgrade_db_to_v0.6.0.py <db> <server_name> <signing_key>
  {code}

  We need to standardise on how we expect people to run Synapse to avoid writing confusing instructions like this.

  My suggestion is that we follow the classic UNIX autoconf pattern, and encourage them to download a tarball, expand it into a source dir, and install it from there.  Only if they are actually developing on it should they run the synapse from the download directory.

  So:

  {code}
  # for initial install:
  git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git
  python setup.py install --user # or --prefix if preferred

  # for upgrades:
  git pull
  # to pull in any new deps:
  python setup.py install --user # or --prefix if preferred
  {code}

  Does this sound okay?

    Provided this has got the caveats about requiring {{libjpeg-dev}}, {{libffi-dev}}, {{python-dev}}, etc then yes this sounds fine. I've installed synapse on a number of fresh devices recently, and it's not painful at all to do this via {{git clone}} rather than {{pip install}}. 

    That being said, there's also issues with the synapse executable, which {{pip install}} allows you to create. It doesn't fully work properly atm iirc thanks to distutils suckage. If we go down the {{git clone}} route, we'd have to tell people to put {{synctl}} on their PATH, but that doesn't seem too bad.
