  Currently, if you're invited to a room, you only get the {{m.room.member}} event. This means you do not know the name of the room you're about to join, or any aliases. This makes display on a recents screen rather frustrating, opting for "so and so has invited you to a room".

  Proposal # 1
  =========
  Exposing a subset of state events to invited users, like {{m.room.name}} and {{m.room.aliases}} in a room /initialSync or room /state request.

  Proposal # 2
  =========

  Include a subset of the room state such as the name, and aliases within the invite event itself.

    Federation has the problem that annoyingly the {{/invite}} API doesn't seem to have a wrapping object, i.e. the content _is_ the event, rather than having the event as a subkey. This is annoying.

    Solutions:

    # Create new API endpoint, new servers will try new API endpoint and then fallback to the old one.
    # Hack the extra information into the unsigned bit of the event.
    # Start thinking about a v2 federation API.
    # Have the receiving server do a separate query for the current state of the invite event.
