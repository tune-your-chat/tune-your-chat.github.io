  There's a lot of older code (that predates {{STYLE-GUIDE.rst}}) which is written in the form

  {noformat}
      return unless CONDITION;
  {noformat}

  especially in filters used by {{await_event_for}} or similar places. These should probably be updated to reflect the prevailing style suggested by the style guide into

  {noformat}
      CONDITION or return;
  {noformat}
