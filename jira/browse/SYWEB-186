  We have a (relatively) consistent way of naming controllers, but for filters and services we're using a mix of approaches. I would prefer to include the type of dependency in the name given you don't instantly know otherwise (modulo injected filters which angular suffixes with {{Filter}}).

  Based on this, I propose:
   - Services shall have the suffix {{Service}}
   - Filters shall start with a lower-case {{f}} (specifically NOT with the suffix {{Filter}} since this would make injected filters {{fooFilterFilter}})
   - Controllers continue as they are with the suffix {{Controller}}
   - Directives shall have the suffix {{Directive}} (slightly annoying that it is longer given it will be written in the HTML, but consistency trumps the extra characters imo)

  Dependencies should also really be namespaced for matrix, given we're encouraging people to use bits and pieces, we don't want our stuff to namespace collide with theirs. I propose they should be standardised with the prefix {{mx}}.

  So the end result will look something like:
   - {{HomeController}} -> {{mxHomeController}}
   - {{mUserDisplayName}} -> {{mxfUserDisplayName}}
   - {{eventStreamService}} -> {{mxEventStreamService}}
   - {{commandHistory}} -> {{mxCommandHistoryDirective}} (or {{mx-command-history-directive}} in the HTML)

  A lot of these decisions are arbitrary with some justification, but the lack of consistency is frustrating currently.
