  Both sides will have to support this for it to work so it's going to suck if we get clients that don't support it: we should spec it sooner rather than later.

  Requirements:
    * Between different devices (same person)
    * Same device moving networks
    * Transferring a call switchboard style in-house
    * Possibly: just redirecting a call somewhere else entirely?

  Some of these would be just transferring the media (ie. ICE renegotiation). Others would involve moving signalling too.

  For just moving media, it would be nice to keep this as simple as possible, possibly just telling the client to start ICE over again.
