  We are almost following http://www.artandlogic.com/blog/2013/05/ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-1-of-3/ when it comes to project structure, but not quite.

  Notably, there is no top-level {{app}} directory, making it REALLY ANNOYING to say where our {{.js}} files are (see {{test/karma.conf.js}} for proof of the ugliness currently). I am proposing that the folders {{home, login, recents, room, user, settings, components}} all go into a directory {{app}} e.g. {{app/home}}. This *includes* {{components}} since that contains huge amounts of our business logic. I also want to move the {{app*}} files which are currently in the top-level into the {{app}} folder.

  I am not proposing we leak our test {{.spec.js}} files into the general project structure, unlike what the link above advises.
