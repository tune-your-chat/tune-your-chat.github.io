  Hi everyone,

  I have problem when using matrix android sdk. The code below not fire the listener when initial sync complete. My current sdk from your mater branch. I have checked out yesterday.

  mSession.getDataHandler().addListener(mEventListener);

  By the way, i have tried the matrix sdk in your sample (may it older) and it working.

    Weird, it works properly with the console application (this is the application which uses the SDK by now) : Have a look on SplashActivity.

    Could you try your credentials with the console application ?
    Are you sure that the initial sync is really finished ?
    Could you provide us some logs ?

    Thanks @yannick, 

    As i said,  i have tried the matrix sdk in your sample (console application) and it work and when i use sdk version v0.4.3 it not work.

    I'm not sure about the initial sync complete. But, i've waited 30 mins. 

    By the way, i have found some source of sdk (version 0.4.3) for finding out problems and then i saw the code below in class  DefaultEventsThreadListener.class 

    @Override
        public void onInitialSyncComplete(InitialSyncResponse response) {
            // sanity check
            if (null != response) {
                // Handle presence events
                mData.handleLiveEvents(response.presence);

                // Convert rooms from response
                for (RoomResponse roomResponse : response.rooms) {
                    mData.handleInitialRoomResponse(roomResponse);
                }

                // save the latest token
                //mData.getStore().setEventStreamToken(response.end);
                //mData.getStore().commit();
            }


            mData.onInitialSyncComplete();
        }

    i have commented lines mData.getStore().setEventStreamToken(response.end) and mData.getStore().commit() and it work

    It look like the store developing and it not done yet.

    I tried my side with the 0.4.3 : it seems working properly (i compiled again the SDK code).

    i suspect an infinite loop, a crash or a thread lock in one of theses both methods (even if i never got one).
    Could you investigate where the lock is ?

    thank you

    You sure it work properly ?. I dont know what my wrong, but my writing so simple, just login -> get session -> add listener and the answer is not work.

    private IMXEventListener mEventListener = new MXEventListener() {

            @Override
            public void onInitialSyncComplete() {
                super.onInitialSyncComplete();

                // Go to the home page
                startActivity(new Intent(SplashActivity.this, MainActivity.class));
                SplashActivity.this.finish();
            }
        };

    I've waited, and nothing occur in onInitialSyncComplete() function

    Could you show me your code or samples you wrote ?

    Thank you :D

    The console application could not work if onInitialSyncComplete was not called.

    The code is the console one : i.e. i recompiled the SDK in debug (clean build), make a fresh install.

    I never tested on the device emulator.

    Could you check why the code seems tuck in theses two lines ?

    //mData.getStore().setEventStreamToken(response.end);
    //mData.getStore().commit();

    Note that: two lines above in "matrix android sdk" source code and i have commented it for finding out problems. 

    In matrix-andriod-sdk version 0.2.4-dev i don't saw two that lines
    In matrix-android-sdk version 04.3 it visible.

    I went to implementations of that functions and i saw:
    - setEventStreamToken(response.end): Just set token(string type) to member of a class
    - commit() is blank function

    I think the problems are sdk not stable version. It seem developing and would have more changes

    Finally, i using matrix-sdk version 0.2.4-dev (used by samples app) for my application.

    P/s: I've been tested on Google Nexus 7

    The latest SDK uses a file cache (it was not defined in version 0.2.4) : it explains why theses both lines have been added.

    the SDK should be stable : it is used by the console application. 

    We could find out why it does not work with your help because i don't reproduce it.

    If you don't want to help, use 0.2.4-dev sdk.
