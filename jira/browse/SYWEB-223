  From AlienCQ:

  Here is new input box proposal, as we spoke on irc:

  Up/Down - navigation in multiline editor
  Ctrl+Up/Down - Message history
  Enter - send message
  Shift+Enter - line break in multiline editor

  Additionally:
  1. It's more convenient to have simple dragbar to resize input box, rather than a handle in a corner.
  2. The frame around input box is too thick - less space for the editor itself.

  See Psi+ inputbox for an example.

  ------------------

  My suggestion is that Up/Down should still do message history unless you actually have multiline input, at which point it should change to navigating within the multiline --M

    done on develop as of 84c67b15. I want to keep the current behaviour that normal up/down keys navigate history (as per normal readline-style navigation), so the way it's implemented is:
     * shift-enter: enter linebreak
     * enter: send
     * up/down: navigate history, unless you're in a multiline text input, where it navigates within that message instead. if you try to go 'off the top' or 'off the bottom', it back into navigating history.

    I think we really need ctrl-up/down as explicit shortcuts to history navigation. It's too long to scroll through every line in multiline messages.

    Additionally: IMO, resizing handle should be placed in different location (see attached picture).

  body: Implemented ctrl-up/down too. agreed the CSS needs to be fixed somehow too.

  body: CSS is fixed by autoexpanding the text input on multiline entry (up to a max of 3 lines, currently).  A draggable expander as suggested by Alien could also be nice at some point.

  body: i put in a draggable expander too for good luck. (if you drag it, it clobbers the autoexpanding behaviour, unless you shrink it back to default).
