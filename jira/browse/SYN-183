  Update both the avatar URL and displayname of a user who is in a few rooms at the same time. You will get *two* m.room.member events which have exactly the same content (with both keys changed). I would expect either:
   - 2 m.room.member events with a single changed key per event.
   - 1 m.room.member event with 2 changed keys.
  But not 2 m.room.member events with 2 changed keys (the same ones).

  This is annoying because it results in things like SYWEB-145. It's also not easy to fix, because if you diff the {{prev_content}} and {{content}} you get the same diff (both avatar and name) twice, resulting in.. a duplicate message.
