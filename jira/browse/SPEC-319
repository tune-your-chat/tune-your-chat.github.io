  This information is missing in the specification of "rooms/roomId/messages" API.

  Presently when we hit the end of pagination the chunk is empty and both tokens start/end are equal (see attachment EndOfPagination.png).

    Note: chunk.count =0 is not enough to decide end of pagination. The client must check start token = end token in server response.

    Indeed the client may receive empty chunk during back pagination on a period where the user was outside the room.

    Example: I joined a room, I left it, others sent more than 20 messages while I am outside, then I joined again.
    I receive empty chunk when I scroll back in room history. The start/end tokens are different in this case.
