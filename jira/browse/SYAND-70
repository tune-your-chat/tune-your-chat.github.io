  "
  This is a notification that your app, Matrix Console (Alpha), with package name org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha, has not been accepted as an Android Auto app on Google Play.
  REASON FOR EXCLUSION:

  -Your app includes features that distract the driver.

  -Your app does not perform all functions properly or as expected from a user perspective.

  -When messages are sent to the user, the messages are read out after the senders username.   

  -Message groupings do not group together. When a message grouping is sent, only the last message is read out and only one message will be counted in the notification. 

  Please refer to the following developer page for full details on the criteria that your app must meet to qualify as an Android Auto app on Google Play:
