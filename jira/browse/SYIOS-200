  Lot of people move from CoreData to Realm. Reasons are: performance, better multithreading support, easier maintenance, etc...

  FTR, MXCoreDataStore is not used because CoreData fails to handle thousands of state events a room can have. Indeed, CD is not good to handle thousands of entries changes in a db even with multithreading techniques advised by Apple.
  For this case, MXCoreDataStore performance is worse than MXFileStore. That's why we continue to use the basic MXFileStore.

  Realm could be a good candidate. It worths to test it.
