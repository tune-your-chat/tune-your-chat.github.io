description: |-
  The current implementation makes retries every 5s (with a jitter of 3s) for request errors that are not rate limit nor connection lost. 

  5-8s for a first retry is bit long for a minor error. It could be 0,5s for the first retry then the period can exponentially grow up to the MXHTTPOperation.maxRetriesTime.
