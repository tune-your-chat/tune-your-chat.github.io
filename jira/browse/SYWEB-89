  If the screen can contain the 30 last messages without needing to enable the div scrolling, it is impossible to paginate back. $scope.paginateMore connected to infinite-scroll is never call.

  This situation can also happen when the first pagination fails somehow. In this case, the user cannot paginate back to retrieve missing messages
