  LinuxFR.org chat implementation has an interesting feature called norloges - see linuxfr.org/wiki/tribune#les-horloges.

  These are timestamps which can also be used as unique(?) IDs for identifying messages for threading purposes.  So when responding to a particular message in the past, you go and click on its timestamp, which copies the timestamp into your text entry box.  Your response is thus tagged as a response to that particular message - providing a simple threading mechanism.

  It would be fun to use this as a UI backed by v2's 'relates-to' feature in order to implement basic threading.
