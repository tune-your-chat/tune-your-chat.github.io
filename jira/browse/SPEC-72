summary: Consider adding txnId in event content

  When posting a message with PUT /rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}, the client can provide a txnId.
  It will be useful for the app when it gets back this event to be able to retrieve this txnId.

  The use case that is currently a problem is local echo.
  When the app posts a message, this message can come down in the event stream before the response of the post request.
  This is hard for the app to guess that this live event is indeed already locally echoed.

  For simple case, ie one local at a time, it can lead to some flickering: the echo and the true message can be displayed in the same time for short time.

    One workaround for the app (or the sdk) would be to pause the event stream before making the post message request and resume it when it gets the request response.
    So that the app will know the event id of the posted messages before it comes down in the event stream.

    Not nice but it should help to avoid flickering.
