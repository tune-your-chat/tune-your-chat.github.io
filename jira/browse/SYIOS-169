  The app spends a certain amount of time for converting MXEvent objects from JSON. It may worth to optimise it.

  Two ideas:
   - Skip Mantle. Try to do the conversion by hand and compare the conversion duration.
   - Process batch of events within a thread. On an initialSync, processing thousands of state events for a room has visible impact on the UI. They could be converted in MXRestClient before calling the request success block callback

    FTR, the 1st idea, skip Mantle, Mantle has been implemented on a separate commits batch: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/38.
    MXEvents processing is now more than 10x quicker.
