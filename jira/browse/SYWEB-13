    We may not completely want to refuse to run on a given web-browsers type and version. It may be preferable to disable the features that are not supported by a browser like we plan to do for voip.
    Here is a the list of needed browser capabilities and how there are supported by the browsers.

    The "modern"/HTML5 features currently required by the webclient are:
     - WebStorage (localStorage, sessionStorage): http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage
     - FileReader API: http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=filereader
     - FileList API: http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=input-file-multiple
     - Canvas: http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=canvas
     - webrtc: http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=rtcpeerconnection

    *Mandatory features*
    - WebStorage: Several parts of the app used WebStorage, so this feature is quite mandatory but it is widely supported. We can refuse to run on browsers that do not support it.

    *Optional features*
    Other features are limited to an app component which can be disabled at runtime (with information provided to the user):
     - FileReader,  FileList to select a file to upload
     - Canvas to produce thumbnail for HTML5 file image
     - webRTC to voip

    *IE case*
    IE 10 and IE 11 run the same HTML5 features of our scope. The webclient runs correctly on both version except 2 bugs that should be fixable:
     - Buttons in the header are taller than the header
     - The upload of image and avatar do not work

    IE 9: The app layout is the same as IE10/11. The input file selection does not work and crashed the app (FileList is not available). There are workarounds.
    IE 8: not tested. too old

    As first cut, please let's just lock out IE8 and earlier, and anyone who doesn't have webstorage.

    Agreed the other features (VoIP and image-sending) can be disabled if the browser doesn't support them.

    For image-sending, we *have* to implement server-side thumbnailing to support this scenario - but that's a separate bug (SYN-32)

    If running IE 8 or older, or if the browser does not support web storage, the app starts on a "non supported" page indicating the browser user agent and the reason why the app does not start.

    The "send image" and the "call" button are disabled if the browser lacks the feature. 
    There is a tip explaining the reason when the user mouses over these buttons
