<p>more good crypto news this week from Canada: the Online Harms Act looks to be explicitly protecting end-to-end encryption and private communications - in contrast to the UK Online Safety Bill/Act.  Looks like all attempts to educate around the UK OSB might have not been entirely in vain. You can see it direct from Justice Minister Arif Virani here: <a href="https://youtu.be/TjDrAlfhNAA?t=1766">https://youtu.be/TjDrAlfhNAA?t=1766</a></p>

<p>No Matrix Live this week, but there will be plenty of Matrix talks (live!) on
Sunday at FOSDEM in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/matrix/">Matrix
devroom</a>, and at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3345-opening-up-communication-silos-with-matrix-2-0-and-the-eu-digital-markets-act/">Matthew's
main track
talk</a>.
The talks are livestreamed, so you can follow even if you aren't at FOSDEM (or
if you <em>are</em> in FOSDEM but the room is full).  If you are at FOSDEM, you can
also find live Matrix people at the matrix.org stand in Building K, level 2.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve made huge strides over the last year, with the Foundation more robust and independent than ever before, and there‚Äôs a lot to be excited about in the future. Critically, we still need more organizations to step up to fund our work before January 2025.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Beeper, Gematik, Fractal Networks, Fairkom, Thunderbird, and the hundreds of individuals who have already stepped up!

<p>If you haven't yet seen the blog post, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/23/matrix-v1.8-release/">check it out</a>. Room version 11 is new in this release, and we've already got an idea for what Matrix 1.9 looks like :)</p>
<h2 id="new-mscs-in-detail">New MSCs in detail</h2>
<p>In this new segment, we aim to give a bit more context as to <em>why</em> an MSC was opened, beyond what is available in the MSC's introduction.</p>
<p>MSC4049 is <em>highly experimental</em> investigative work into what it would take to support making messages as appearing to be sent by a room or server instead of a user. There are some use cases highlighted in the MSC itself, but the primary driving factor is a point of relatively minor feedback from the MIMI working group: "does <code>sender</code> really need to be a user ID?". The spike-shaped experiment overlaps heavily with both crypto IDs and pseudo IDs by accident, but might help inform those two projects via MSC4047 and MSC4046. Currently there is not a plan to push any of the 3 MSCs towards FCP, though feedback is very much welcome on how the stack feels.</p>
<p>MSC4048 is part of the crypto team's mission to improve encryption across all of Matrix, with this particular MSC looking to improve the trustworthiness of key backups. Watch this space for updates as the MSC progresses, and please provide feedback on the proposal itself.</p>

<p>We have a release date planned for Matrix 1.8! We're looking at <strong>Wednesday, August 23rd, 2023</strong>, and tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/1614">issue #1614</a>. Currently the only release blocker is room version 11, which should land well in advance of August 23rd. If there's other things we should be considering please raise them ASAP in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>August 23rd also begins the Matrix 1.9 cycle where we'll be sticking to our MSC review plan more strongly. Stay tuned to TWIM for news on the exact MSCs/features we'll be looking at for that cycle, and let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if you think we should consider something in our planning.</p>
<p>The SCT has otherwise been thinking a lot about the MIMI working group at the IETF and how the protocol layering works there. About half of the SCT is going to take a break from MSC review over the next few weeks to ensure the protocol we're designing for MIMI will be fully compatible with Matrix - this will mean that some MSCs will move slower through FCP, sorry.</p>
<p>As always, if you have questions, concerns, complaints, etc then let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> üôÇ</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week we have been preparing for IETF117, Matrix 1.8, Matrix 1.9, and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/a-giant-leap-with-mls/">Messaging Layer Security (MLS) for Matrix</a>. Most of our work on globally interoperable communications is ongoing through the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group at the IETF, and will be making significant strides in the coming days as we head to the IETF117 <a href="https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/117/hackathon#linearized-matrix">hackathon</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/">meetup</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last few months we've been working on a version of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix/">Linearized Matrix</a> which supports the simplicity of linear event history while being fully compatible with today's Matrix network, and while we think that the 03 draft we wrote up accomplishes a lot of this, there's further work to be done to make it cleaner and easier to use. We've also been writing implementations of it to prove the semantics (and find areas which need improvement), starting with our cleanroom <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server">eigen-server</a> TypeScript implementation and interoperating it with a branch of Synapse. During IETF117 we expect more implementations to sprout and have their interoperability tested - watch this space for updates on how that goes.</p>
<p>Aside from IETF117, we're continuing to look at the previously-selected Matrix 1.8 MSCs for release in mid-late August 2023. This might be slow over the next couple of weeks while half of us are at IETF117, but expect more forward progress when we get back. Matrix 1.9 is scheduled to be released sometime in November 2023, and a few months ago we said we were aiming to plan ahead for releases a bit more deliberately. Starting this week, we're accepting submissions for ideas and specific MSCs which need our attention in Matrix 1.9. If you have an MSC (current or future) which will need Spec Core Team (SCT) attention between August 2023 and November 2023, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a> room. Once Matrix 1.8 is released (exact date TBD) we will have limited availability to add things to the Matrix 1.9 target - please raise your MSCs &amp; themes as soon as possible. The current set of MSCs up for consideration can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88">SCT Intake Board</a>.</p>
<p>If you've made it this far in our weekly update, congratulations, and thank you. We expect things will rapidly start to happen with IETF117 kicking off tomorrow (July 22, 2023), and we will do our best to keep folks updated. Next week's TWIM in particular will have a post-IETF117 debrief for your reading enjoyment :)</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or concerns about what we're working on, visit the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a> and let us know. We can't promise a prompt reply (particularly during IETF117), but we will take a look when we can.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3105">MSC3105: Previewing UIA flows</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC addresses a shortcoming in the current <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api">User-Interactive Authentication</a> (UIA) mechanism where attempting to deduce the required authentication flows for an action will result in that action being carried out if it turns out no flows were required. This makes it tricky for a client to present a "are you sure you want to do X?" as a final step in completing an action that requires authentication.</p>
<p>The proposals aims to allow an OPTIONS pre-flight HTTP request to the same endpoint in order to retrieve the flows necessary, without actually carrying out the action. The proposal does note that using OPTIONS for this case is a bit non-standard though, and some clients may treat the typical <code>401</code> error code returned during User-Interactive Auth as a fatal error.</p>
<p>While this does address a flaw in the UIA system, it's worth noting that many other flaws exist! Matrix is planning to move over to an OpenID Connect-based authentication system in the not too distant future, which will likely have far fewer edge cases than our traditional, home-grown one. You can visit <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">https://areweoidcyet.com/</a> for more information and to track the current progress on that front.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Given our commitment to open standards and interoperability, we‚Äôre delighted to see MLS be ratified by the IETF as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420">RFC9420</a>.</p>
<p>MLS is a new encryption standard defined by the IETF, the standards body that maintains much of what makes the internet work. In the same way that Transport Layer Security (TLS, another IETF standard) defines the way to provide encryption between users and servers, or between two different servers, MLS provides a standard way for users of a messaging service to communicate securely without servers being able to eavesdrop on their conversations.</p>

Thank you to all who contributed to this release, whether through writing or reviewing MSCs, writing spec PRs, or finding spec bugs.  And congratulations to those who had their first MSC make it to the release.  Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/25/matrix-v-1-7-release">blog post</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>We're in the process of working out what Matrix 1.8 looks like and need to hear what people are working on. If you have an MSC or idea you're planning on looking at in the next 2 months, let us know in #sct-office:matrix.org so we can prioritize it accordingly.</p>

<p>Some of the spec core team have been on holidays this week, but we still finished FCP on one MSC, and merged another to the spec.  As mentioned in last week's update, progress will be slower over the holiday season, but we'll be back in the new year, working to make Matrix better.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2783">MSC2783: Homeserver Migration Data Format</a>!  If you're running a homeserver using one implementation, it's currently impossible to switch to a different implementation without losing data.  This MSC proposes a file format for exporting data from one implementation and importing it into another.</p>

<p>Conduit is getting a lot more usable with this release, the main missing feature is backfill over federation (loading room messages from before your server joined a room).
To update conduit, simply stop it, replace the binary and start it again.

<p>Ho ho ho Matrix fans!</p>
<p>It's that time of year again, and we have a special gift for all of you just in time for the holidays: Neochat now supports end-to-end encryption! This is made possible thanks to the release of libQuotient 0.7.</p>
<p>While this feature is still somewhat experimental, it's a big step forward in ensuring the privacy and security of your conversations. Just keep in mind that if your only logged-in client is Neochat and something goes wrong, you might lose your messages.</p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to try out the new end-to-end encryption feature, you can already get it from Flathub and some distros. We're also working on supporting it in our Windows, Android, and macOS builds, so stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of the season, here's a Christmas joke: Why was the JavaScript developer's house cold? Because he left his closure open!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and happy chatting, everyone!</p>

<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre still working on Notifications, reviewing how they work across platforms for new users, and planning the improvements we‚Äôre looking to make in the new year. While we look at this user experience holistically, we‚Äôre making some subtle changes to the product including removing the bold dot and ordering rooms by activity by default for new users.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also continuing to improve the password reset flow so that user‚Äôs who can‚Äôt remember their passwords have a smoother experience regaining access to their account.</li>
<li>And, thanks to a contribution we now have the ability to multi-select members when changing users‚Äô permissions in a room! Head to Room Settings &gt; Roles &amp; Permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich text editor improvements are still coming so be sure to check them out, including updates to emoji handling and  inline code formatting.</li>
<li>Threads! Threads notifications and performance improvements are landing thick and fast. We‚Äôre nearly ready to enable the feature by default and we‚Äôll be excited to do that in the new year.
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check that you‚Äôre still in the threads beta for this release as in fixing some bugs your setting may have been changed.</li>

<h1 id="libquotient-0-7">libQuotient 0.7</h1>
<p>It took us (yes, us - there's more than one person actively working on the project!) a very long time but libQuotient 0.7.0 is out, with a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0">huge wall of release notes</a>. Big, big, BIG thanks to Carl Schwan and Tobias Fella for their contributions and early adoption of this release in NeoChat (NeoChat maintained compatibility with libQuotient's development branch, along with the stable branch, for quite some time by now). A short summary of most significant things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: C++20, Qt 5.15 or 6.x</li>
<li>E2EE code is now in beta quality, features:
<ul>
<li>sending/receiving new messages</li>
<li>getting historical messages where Megolm keys are already loaded</li>
<li>encrypting/decrypting attachments</li>
<li>device verification (to-device flow only, no in-room verification yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual APIs for <code>m.fully_read</code> and <code>m.read</code> markers</li>
<li>Client-Server API backend uses Matrix 1.5 API definitions</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of the event types framework to make it truly extensible; you can now add both base classes and specific event types on the client side without touching the library code (the library still provides standard ones)</li>
<li>Account registry for multi-account usage; account access tokens and pickling keys are stored with Qt Keychain</li>
<li>Sticker events support</li>
<li>Pinned messages support</li>
<li>First-class support in Network Access Manager for <code>mxc:</code> URLs, to enable showing inline images in messages</li>
<li>A lot of code tightening, bug fixing, performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to those who observe those - and hopefully I'll get to my senses and release 0.8 sooner than in another year üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</h1>
<p>As part of the efforts for working on detecting spam using ML I started to write a moderation bot.</p>
<p>This bot is written from scratch with some design decisions that hopefully will improve usability for both newcomers and seasoned admins.</p>
<p>These decisions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an action can be done using a reaction, then it will be done using a reaction.</li>
<li>There is a private admin room and a public room for warnings, where admins issue actions. This is meant to serve as a human-readable ban list if admins want to provide this to their users.</li>
<li>The bot will at a later point be able to issue reports to server admins via email and matrix easily by allowing admins to just react after doing a ban. The bot will initially ask how to contact a server if it didn't issue a report to the server before. The bot will remember the setting supplied last time for a server and allows updating the settings if they change. These reports will contain a warning that it was issued from the bot and that replies are necessary for it to be properly relayed back to the admins for further questions. These replies will end up as threads in the admin room. Also, as part of the report, the event JSON for the report will be sent with the report to allow server admins to review the case themselves. (This is still WIP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The warnings also contain a "false positive" action. This is meant to be used to feed back into the used model for further training and improving it.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope to simplify the process of moderation based on what I experienced as an admin. Feel free to chime in at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a> to suggest ideas for the bot. At the time of writing, it is still very much a prototype/demo.</p>
<p>The code can be found at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml/tree/main/bot</p>
<p>Documentation can be found at: https://mtrnord.github.io/matrix-spam-ml/bot</p>
