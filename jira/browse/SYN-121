  Most most bizarre. Latest {{sytest}} code currently produces the following:

    {"errcode":"M_UNKNOWN","error":"Unable to join remote room"}

  Addtionally, the failure takes about 10 seconds to happen; it isn't instant.

  This happens if I create a room with an alias, then leave it, then try to join it again by that alias.
