    Right now the verto bridge is hard-coded that the user must be :matrix.org, and its name is deterministically generated from the room ID, which conveniently means that you can't invite multiple different verto users into a room to start multiple conferences in parallel.

    We wish to remove the hard-coded username restrictions, which means we may end up in a situation where multiple conference users are present in one room. We should use a state event or something to choose which one the canonical one is.
