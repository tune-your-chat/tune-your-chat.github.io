  Rather than only storing one list per user on a HS the concept of lists could be abstracted into just having lists that certain users (private/public) can subscribe too. Similar to lists on twitter or facebook.

  These would then work similar to how rooms work but instead just passing along the listed users presence events.

    Mmm, this would be really nice. Right now we do have early support for defining per-user presence lists seperate from rooms, but totally agreed that having arbitrary UNIX-group style lists that can then be used for ACLs, Presence, etc would be really nice.

    Leo: how would this fit with the current presence-list management?
