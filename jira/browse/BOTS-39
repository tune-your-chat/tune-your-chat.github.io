  The IRC AS is receiving what looks to be 1 onUserQuery per real IRC user on OM IRC. It shouldn't be doing that. We should be pre-emptively creating the user when we get an onUserQuery to prevent Synapse from re-querying it when it next sees it. 

  Currently, we only make Matrix users when the IRC user says something: this was fine before we introduced membership list syncing, but now we have tons of lurkers which get queried (due to the join/leaves) and never created as proper Matrix users, which slows down the whole thing on startup (when the IRC AS gets the member lists for each channel).
