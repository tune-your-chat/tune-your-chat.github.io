  (I can't find anywhere else to report olm bugs?!)
  I *think* olm_account_identity_keys generates a chunk of JSON containing the identity keys, but olm.h doesn't say.
  It's actually a pain it works this way; I'm building JSON structures using glib so am now going to have to parse this JSON to extract them so I can stuff them back into my own JSON structure.
  (I suspect this might also get the 'algorithms' list which I also need, but which again I don't see a way to get out of olm.h)

    Yup, there is no way to extract the keys individually.

    In general a wish has been expressed for lower-level APIs to libolm which don't do some of the JSON/base64 wrapping. I've raised https://github.com/matrix-org/olm/issues/1 to track it.
