description: |-
  The client should list the rooms that a user used to be present in.
  The list should display the name of the room.
  It should be possible to see the timeline of the room up to the point the user left.

  Open Questions:
    1) Should the user be able to see the current name of the room, or the name of the room when they left the room?
    2) Should the user be able to remove rooms from this list?

  Proposal #1
  =========

  Add rooms where the user has a m.room.member status of "leave" to the recent rooms list.
  Only allow users to view the messages and state up to the point where they left the room.


  Cons:
  * No way to remove a room from the list.
