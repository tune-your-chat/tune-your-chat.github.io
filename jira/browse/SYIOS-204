  [MXKRoomDataSource paginateBackMessagesToFillRect] is wrong.

  The first time it is called, it has no bubbles. So, it bases its events need computation on 44px per event, which results for a need of 20 messages on a iPhone 5s. 
  As the store contains 10 messages (at least), it may need to make a server request to get all 20 messages.

  It is a pity because most of time 5 messages is enough to fill the screen.
