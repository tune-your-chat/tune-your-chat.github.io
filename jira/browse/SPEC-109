  The equivalent of 'conference' mode on IRC servers - where you can't see who else is listening in on the room; you can only see the handful of people with permission to talk.

  This presumably means
  * adding a power level below which participants aren't shown in the membership list
  * adding a power level above which participants are shown in the membership list if desired

  or, just a way to filter/unfilter the membership list based on powerlevel?
