  On the Android client an unsuccessful login results in a toast containing the  error message "Unable to login: (M_FORBIDDEN)".

  A couple issues here:
  - The toast is easy to miss, leaving a bewildered user looking at a stationary form without indication of something having happened. 
  - The message itself is non-specific. There is no way to know if one failed authentication because of fat fingers or a maintenance event or whatever.  

  Alternatives:
  - Create a better error message, for example, "Invalid login credentials" or "Login credentials not recognized".
  - Ditch the toast and update the UI to display the UX-friendly message as above.
