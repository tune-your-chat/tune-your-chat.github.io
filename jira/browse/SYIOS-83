    Note: The actual timestamp of the attachment is set at the end of upload.
    Solution: During attachment uploading, any new outgoing and incoming message must be inserted above the attachment bubble.

  body: This would be quite surprising behaviour for a user, who expects sent messages to be appended to the list, not inserted above uploading attachments.  Imagine how bad it'd be if you upload a series of pictures, send a text, only for the text to disappear off the top of the page.  Surely we just set the timestamp at the beginning of the upload instead?

    The timestamp is not set by the client. It is set by the server when message is posted.
    That is why attachment does not have actual timestamp until the end of upload.
    We need to wait for this upload to get back the attachment uri in matrix content repository before posting the attachment and then obtain the attachment timestamp.

    I don't think the client can force the message timestamp, do I am wrong?

    In order to avoid jump around, we should keep the uploading attachment at the bottom of the room history. Is that ok?

  body: Okay. can we not just set our own timestamp clientside and ignore what the server says for uploaded images, as a workaround?

  body: No, because you will not have the same history order for all users (and for all devices).

    I implemented my suggestion "keep the uploading attachment at the bottom of the room history", and the result is not convincing :(. I decided to not commit changes.
    The weak point of this solution is to handle correctly the scroller offset to focus on live stream at the bottom of the history when upload is in progress...

    The right solution should be to display uploading attachments outside the history, and add them into history when attachment is done.

    At the end, I will implement the Matthew's suggestion :"set our own timestamp clientside and ignore what the server says for uploaded images". The actual timestamp will be considered in case of a room history refresh (for example: when user goes back to Recents and selects again the room).
