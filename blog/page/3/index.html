            <p>The Matrix.org Foundation is happy to <a href="https://2024.matrix.org">launch the first Matrix Conference</a>, this September 19th to 22nd in Berlin, Germany, at <a href="https://mitosis.co/en/">Mitosis Labs</a>! Click on the picture bellow to learn more!</p>

</a>
<p>Building on the success of the Matrix Community Summit, the Foundation is joining forces with the Summit team to open the conference to wider audiences. This is the event that policy makers, public and private sector leaders, open source enthusiasts, and technologists attend to share knowledge and learn what‚Äôs next in the decentralised and secure communications sector.</p>
<p>This is THE gathering place for hackers, project managers, digital sovereignty leaders and innovators. With several tracks covering everything from sovereignty &amp; collaboration in the public sector to digital rights and advocacy, all profiles will find content for their interest. Outside of the tracks there will be plenty of time and space to get to know others from the ecosystem and exchange ideas.</p>

            <p>If you have been following the matrix.org blog for some time, you will know that we‚Äôve never been ones to shy away from complex topics like public policy and its impacts on Matrix. With this blog post series, our aim is to introduce a more regular cadence to our regulatory updates and to be more transparent about where we are focusing our efforts in this area.</p>
<p>Each blog post in the series will focus on a given theme or piece of law, as well as its relevant jurisdiction. We will start this series by taking a deep dive into EU regulation, starting with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Future blog posts in the series will cover the digital services package (DMA and DSA), the incoming CRA and the highly controversial CSAM regulation. These will be followed by a series dedicated to the UK, particularly UK applications of European law such as the GDPR and ePrivacy directive, as well as the Online Safety Act and the IPA amendment bill. Finally, we will conclude the series by looking across the pond and diving into the Cloud Act, as well as KOSA and other existing proposals.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the winning candidates, we thank you for your willingness to serve the community. We‚Äôre also grateful to everyone who threw their hat in the ring, and hope that the candidates who did not get elected consider running again in the future ‚Äì noting that we have an election of Gold, Silver, Individual, and Associate Members scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>Thanks also to all of the people who cast ballots in the election, and to everyone who asked questions along the way! We learned a lot in this first election process that we look forward to incorporating into the next one.</p>
<p>The level of engagement with the process was a very encouraging sign for the health of the Matrix ecosystem, and we‚Äôre proud to have had 100% voter turnout in all but one constituency.</p>
<p>Read on to see who is on the Governing Board, a brief discussion of next steps, and reflections on some of the work that remains to improve representation.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals">https://spec.matrix.org/proposals</a>.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4148">MSC4148: Permitting HTTP(S) URLs for SSO IdP icons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4147">MSC4147: Including device keys with Olm-encrypted events</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4115">MSC4115: membership information on events</a> (merge)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were accepted this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closed MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This last week's focus was primarily spent on ensuring MSCs are moving towards Final Comment Period (FCP; the step before an MSC is accepted) at a healthy pace. Below are the MSCs which were on Tuesday's pings, and their current status:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916">MSC3916: Authenticated media</a>
<ul>
<li>Needs just 2 more checkmarks SCT members to enter FCP (started the week needing 6).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4138">MSC4138: More methods in CORS</a>
<ul>
<li>Needs 1 more checkmark from the SCT to enter FCP (started the week needing 1).</li>
<li>Currently blocked on clarified text regarding its scope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2781">MSC2781: Removing reply/edit fallbacks</a>
<ul>
<li>Needs just 2 more checkmark from the SCT to enter FCP (started the week needing 2).</li>
<li>Currently blocked on some clarified behaviour and process ordering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>
<ul>
<li>Needs checkmarks from 3 more SCT members to enter FCP (started the week needing 3).</li>
<li>Currently blocked on ensuring that this addition to spec doesn't make notifications more complicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Client and server developers are encouraged to review these MSCs in particular because they're on a path to being included in the next spec version. This doesn't have to mean implementing them, but if there's something which doesn't sound quite right in the proposal text then leave a comment on the diff to raise a concern. The SCT will take these comments into consideration as the MSC enters FCP - the 5 day countdown to ensure any last comments are considered before the proposal is accepted into the spec as stable.</p>
<p>Next week's focus will largely be the same as usual: we'll focus on unblocking Matrix 2.0 MSCs/features as a priority, and MSCs which require more checkboxes to enter FCP will be raised for prompt review. We're always on the lookout for MSCs ready for FCP, but can sometimes miss something - let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if it looks like something is ready to go but hasn't caught our eye yet.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>As an early heads up, Trust &amp; Safety at the Foundation is working on an important update to Matrix, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916">MSC3916 - Authenticated Media</a>. <strong>This change will mean that all clients (and servers) will need to present a valid access token in their Authentication header to access media</strong> - which is critical to ensure that URLs are only visible to the correct users, and prevents abuse of Matrix for hosting binaries.  More details will be published as we work to get everything released - we wanted to get the information out there as early as possible in the meantime. Let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Matrix.org plans to freeze unauthenticated media endpoints within a couple of months after the spec release, which is expected in the next few weeks. "Freezing" means that media uploaded or cached before the freeze will remain accessible via unauthenticated endpoints indefinitely, but any media cached or uploaded after the freeze will require authentication. The unauthenticated endpoints will be deprecated but will still serve old media on matrix.org.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth transition, we encourage you to start testing against the unstable endpoints and unreleased server builds. The changes for Synapse are being developed <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/pull/17172">here</a>, and for MMR <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/pull/509">here</a>. Both are expected to release their changes soon. Once MSC3916 passes FCP, stable endpoints will become available. While releasing unstable support to users isn't required, having patches ready will help speed up the rollout.</p>
<p>We know this is a quicker rollout than usual, but with your help, we can improve user safety and security across the ecosystem. Most clients should find this update straightforward, but if issues are encountered, please reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org">#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org</a> or on the MSC discussion. The team is monitoring the room to help clients adopt the change.</p>
<p>Web browser clients might face the most challenges, given the need to specify an Authentication HTTP header on media requests, so reviewing <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/pull/27326">this pull request</a> and its dependencies could provide useful implementation insights.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. If you have any questions, let us know. We look forward to a smooth transition with minimal user-visible impact üôÇ</p>
