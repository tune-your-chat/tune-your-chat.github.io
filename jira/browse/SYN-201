summary: Should we trust remote thumbnails to avoid regenerating local ones?

  Currently the media repo implementation rethumbnails all content it receives.

  So if A sends a video to B, B will not be able to see the message meaningfully (i.e. with a thumbnail) until the whole video has been replicated over to B's server where it can be thumbnailed.

  I propose that we should trust A's thumbnails of the content and save us the  pain and delay of re-thumbnailing it ourselves.  This gives us a much better UX, as we can send the thumbnail in advance of the file itself having been replicated over to B (and indeed without ever needing to replicate the content to B, if B doesn't care to download it).

    Personally I'm against this, as it sets a bad precedence for the future.

    Do we know how long the delay is? It seems odd that download full image and then thumbnailing should take _significantly_ longer than just downloading a thumbnail.

  body: my point is that this stops us from ever sending thumbnails in advance of content to allow the "zero latency" filetransfer we had in UC. this is a real shame for ux. the delay is as long as it takes to shift a 40MB vid from A to B or whatever. happy to drop prio tho.
