  When making a login attempt the only indication of something having happened (or happening) between pressing login and either logging in or getting an error toast is a graying of the text on the already gray login and create account buttons. 

  This is inconsistent with modern app UX and android design guides. 

  Suggestion: use and indeterminate progress indicator. For example, a circular or circular integrated progress indicator. 

  See https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html# for reference.
