  I'm using the application service API.

  If I issue a createRoom request specifying an alias that is exclusive to my application service, it is rejected with "This alias is reserved by an application service."

  I read the code and it looks as though the issue is that create_room in synapse/handlers/room.py calls into create_assocation, rather than into create_appservice_association.
