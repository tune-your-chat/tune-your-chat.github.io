  erikj likes the scheme where you just list participants
  <Arathorn> it doesn't scale very well though
  <Arathorn> just calling it "Creator's Group Chat" might be good enough
  <Arathorn> and encourage users to rename the room
  <kegan> hmm.. not sure.
  <erikj> I think list of participants works quite well for small numbers of people, a lot better than "X's Group Chat"
  <erikj> its how facebook does it
  <erikj> I'm not sure how hang out or whatsapp does these things?
  <kegan> my main gripe with these algorithmic ones is that it changes, so if people come and go I'm always like "hang on, what was the name of the room now?"
  <kegan> so then in my head I end up keying off the timestamp
  <kegan> but then again this is asking the purpose of room names: a unique thing to key off, or a summary of the room
  <M-matthew> unique thing to key off.
  <kegan> then we don't really want it to be changing then, do we?
  <M-matthew> hence "X's Group Chat" suggestion
  * kegan nods
  <kegan> was just trying to work through the justification for it
  <M-matthew> it's up to the client implementer
  <M-matthew> but given the current webclient (and iOS) UI, i suggest we just do X's Group Chat for now
  <kegan> it'll still presumably fall back to the other person's name if 3 members drop to 2
  <M-matthew> sure.
  * M-matthew dithers a bit
  <M-matthew> perhaps erik's right
  <M-matthew> as it's otherwise pretty inconsistent
  <kegan> mmm
  <M-matthew> okay, let's just go for list of names and see how it goes
