  Currently, when restarting the app with a permanent MXStore, [MXSession start] currently calls the success callback only after the response of the first event stream request.

  Find a way to indicate to the app that some data are already available (but not up-to-date) so that the app can work offline.

    [MXSession start] takes a new callback parameter: onStoreDataReady. This callback is called when the data from the store is loaded and usable by the SDK client.
    The legacy callback (onInitialSyncDone) is still here but has been renamed to onServerSyncDone. It is still called when the store data is in-sync with the home server.
