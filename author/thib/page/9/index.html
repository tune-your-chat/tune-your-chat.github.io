                <p>For the past two years, FOSDEM couldn‚Äôt happen in-person. Fortunately we could
help, and Matrix hosted the world's largest free &amp; open source software
conference online! This year we were finally back in-person‚Ä¶ but not only.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">The set-up we have arranged in 2021</a>
and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">polished in 2022</a>
has proved to be robust and served us well during the pandemic. Returning to an
in-person conference didn‚Äôt mean we had to throw it all away‚Ä¶ quite the
opposite!</p>

<p>The Matrix Foundation is a candidate this year again to the GSoC programme. If you intend to mentor a student around your Matrix project, please ping me (@thib:ergaster.org) in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> room. Your project doesn't have to be set in stone yet: we need to have a good estimate of the number of mentors and projects applying before FOSDEM (by the end of next week).</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week and the week afterwards, the Spec Core Team are mostly focused on improvements to Matrix that we'd like to show off at FOSDEM 2023 this year! That consists of MSCs related to Faster Room Joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3943">MSC3943</a> among others) and Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>).</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230">MSC3230: Spaces top level order</a>!</p>
<p>This defines an algorithm and a data structure that can be used to order one's top-level list of Spaces and have that order sync across all of their clients. Rooms and spaces within a Space continue to have their order <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#ordering-of-children-within-a-space">defined</a> by an <code>order</code> key (and failing that, the <code>origin_server_ts</code> field) in the corresponding <code>m.space.child</code> event of their parent's Space's state.</p>
<p>I won't get into the details of the algorithm here (or its criticisms), but feel free to jump into the MSC and take a look!</p>

<p>Back in July I started a discussion on wikidata for adding a matrix space property, after much discussion in the wikidata community (lead mostly by tgr) we instead landed on a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P11478">Matrix room property</a>. This now enables slightly more accurate semantics when describing matrix rooms belonging to organizations, projects, and people on wikidata.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.</p>
<p>This week has also seen <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a> become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: "Owned" State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can "own" certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user "owns" a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391: API to delete account data</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow users to actually delete account data they've set üéâ Currently you cannot delete top-level keys from your account data, only remove their content.</p>
<p>Deleted account data items will come down <code>/sync</code> as having their content updated to <code>{}</code>, which clients that implement MSC3391 will take to mean that the account data item has been deleted. Clients that don't implement MSC3391 will store the content as <code>{}</code>, which commonly means an unused account data item anyhow.</p>
<p>Yours truly is currently writing an implementation for this in Synapse, and so far implementing the spec as written seems sound!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's Friday which means it's time to talk about the newest Synapse release, v1.73.0! A few details:</p>
<p>Please note that this version removes legacy Prometheus metric names entirely. This also means that the <code>enable_legacy_metrics</code> configuration option has been removed; it will no longer be possible to re-enable the legacy metric names.</p>
<p>If you use metrics and have not yet updated your Grafana dashboard(s), Prometheus console(s) or alerting rule(s), please consider doing so when upgrading to this version.</p>
<p>In addition, a few notable features and bugfixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoints to stable <code>v1</code> location (<code>/_matrix/client/v1/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>, <code>/_matrix/federation/v1/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>Reduce database load of Client-Server endpoints which return bundled aggregations.</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug where paginating from the start of a room did not work. Contributed by @gnunicorn.</li>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 0.9 where Synapse would fail to fetch server keys whose IDs contain a forward slash</li>

<blockquote>
<p>So... some people are distracting me by asking me to play Valheim all the time since Mistlands was in public beta (it is released now). To make that easier to synchronize, especially if not everyone can be online all the time, I wrote a small bridge: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/valheimmatrix</p>
<p>Your own messages are
bridged from Valheim to Matrix, while other peoples messages are bridged
(privately) from Matrix to Valheim. This prevents loops and does nice puppeting,
but it means everyone needs to run their own bridge. It also means you can see
other peoples messages on Matrix, as long as they have the mod enabled, even if
you are not signed in yourself.</p>
<p>It is a very hacky experiment, but it works, so... why not show it off? Definitely check out the game, it is great!</p>

<p>It's been a tiny while since I've given an update on the Gitter bridge because I've been focusing on other <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">feature parity</a> areas like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13356">speeding up <code>/messages</code> in Synapse</a> but there have been a number of changes over this time üî¢</p>
<p>The first big exciting thing is that <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2309">Gitter now bridges threaded conversations as native threads on Matrix</a> (no more impedance mismatch)!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/bxtVGAtpdvMnLgJZGcabRgza.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We've also been plugging along on less visible changes during this time like bug-fixes for bridging DM's and fleshing out more of the bridge scenarios like <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2200">leaving</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2265">deleting a room</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2257">bans</a> to ensure things stay in sync. We also started <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#21460-2022-02-01-bridge-private-rooms-to-matrix">bridging private conversations</a> to Matrix behind the scenes back in February so we have a break-away point-in-time to import back from when we do the massive history import to backfill everything. Please note, that you still can't access these private rooms on Matrix but this will come later either in the form of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues/2819">inviting MXID's from the Gitter side</a> or when we give access to the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver itself to self-manage from that side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apart from playing Valheim, I at least also did some productive things! (Apart from everyone else who has been helping squashing bugs and jugendhackt of course.)</p>
<p>Nheko now supports MSC3664. Support for this is automatically enabled if it is enabled server side. This allows you to get notifications for events that relate to another event. For example you might want to get notifications for a reply to one of your messages. So you need to check if the replied to event was sent by you. Similar things can be done for relations like "notify me for reactions to my posts in rooms with less than 20 users".</p>
<p>By default only notifications for replies are enabled. You might not notice a difference, since by default you get notified for them because the fallback includes your username, but not all bridges implement that correctly and for me the reply fallback has been one of the biggest sources of bugs, so I'd like to get rid of it long term. (Also some users disable username mentions, because their name is too generic to be useful, in which case this can help as well since it actually checks the sender.)</p>
<p>Anyway, have fun playing around with this!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://effektio.org/2022/12/06/blockchain-is-dead-long-life-web5-the-effektio-white-paper/">we have release</a> the <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper">EFFEKTIO white paper</a>, outlining what we are working on, why we think this matters, where we intend to head with it and what perspective we come from. We‚Äôve published this 30-pager as a Google Doc with comments activated (if you have any feedback on it) as well as with a 2-page executive summary for the busy. You can also join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foyer:effektio.org">#foyer:effektio.org</a> if you‚Äôd like to discuss it with us.</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks now, we have a fresh <a href="https://effektio.org/nightly-build">nightly build</a> available whenever changes have been merged within the 24 hours prior. Unfortunately the Android package, with mobile being the main target the UI has been developed for, can‚Äôt be installed as is (you need to clone and build it yourself for now), the Desktop App for Linux, Windows and Mac do give you an impression what we are after. Mind you that a) other than the chat all sections are still mainly UI mocked and b) it is still in heavy development: things break sometimes.</p>
<p>On the app itself, we have spent a lot of time on getting the chat right. The app‚Äôs core was upgraded to matrix-sdk 0.6+ to get the latest timeline API in, which required quite some refactoring. But allowed us to implement reactions, edits and replies. Encrypted Messages are still somewhat unreliable though. Prior to the nightly builds we‚Äôve also taken some time to clean up the UI to give it a more polished look and make clear which things are simply not enabled yet. On the non-chat side of things, we‚Äôve mostly worked on UI things (check out the ToDo-Sections and Pins), while we were waiting for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14149">synapse fix on reading the timeline from the beginning</a>, which is now released in 1.73. Happy to get back to implementing the state machines soon.</p>

<p>libolm 3.2.14 has been released. This is maintenance release. The main change was improvements in the TypeScript types. There were also some improvements in the Python packaging, which should mean that the pre-built Python package for Linux is compatible with more distributions. Unfortunately, there are some issues with the i686 and aarch64 Linux builds, meaning that those packages are not currently available for the current version. However, if the previous version works for you, there is no reason to upgrade. We are investigating the issue, and may provide new packages later.</p>

<p>If you write code in Elm, you can now send messages in a Matrix room using a webhook.</p>
<p>I built <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks/latest/">noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks</a>, a small wrapper around the Webhook API of <a href="https://github.com/nim65s/matrix-webhook">nim65s/matrix-webhook</a>.</p>
<p>I am building an Matrix SDK in Elm but I've never created or published a library before. This is a practice library to see what I can expect. You can install the library using</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>elm install noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks
</span></code></pre>
<p>And you can send a webhook message using a function like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="color:#569cd6;">import </span><span>Matrix.Webhooks </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>Hook
</span><span>
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">: String -&gt; Cmd </span><span>msg
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">= </span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">Hook</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">.</span><span>sendMessage toMsg webhook
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;Hi TWIM!&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;I support **Markdown!**&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;That&#39;s cool, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>After porting the remaining fixes over from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">demo branch for element-x as PRs to <code>main</code></a>, we've spent a significant time debugging the two biggest know pain points: double echos for sending messages, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1260">for which we've merged a fix</a>, and unable to decrypt, which appears to be caused by a broken to-device message exchange (with an incomplete <code>sender_key</code>), which we are still investigating. Furthermore we've exposed the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1257">send reactions over FFI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1261"><code>LoginBuilder</code> and <code>SsoLoginBuilder</code> can now be used with <code>.await</code></a> and merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1259">some smaller sled crypto store improvements</a>.</p>
<p>The latter came up when investigating, whether we could use <a href="https://docs.rs/sanakirja/latest/sanakirja/">sanakirja</a>, the <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> database backend, as a multi-process crypto store backend for mobile. This investigation is still on-going.</p>
<p>Further than an investigation is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">uniffi async support</a>. After completing the Python backend, Swift is also passing all tests now. Additional Docs should clarify most questions. We are as excited about this as the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409#issuecomment-1331959797">Mozillians</a> seem to be.

<p>It currently only works in unencrypted chats. I haven't managed to get encryption using <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> working reliably yet. If it's meant to be working, tips or PRs are very welcome! I've really enjoyed tinkering with<code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> on a few projects so far.</p>

<p>This MSC aims to provide a solution to remotely toggling do-not-disturb across your various Matrix clients without needing to set it on each device manually. It does so by using account data which is synced to each client. Upon a client seeing data intended for them, they will silence notifications locally until told to do so otherwise (either remotely or by the user interacting with the client directly).</p>
<p>Quite a neat idea, and adds more powerful functionality to the "device manager" of a client. Also handy if your other clients are things like embedded systems!

<p>In the meantime, this release was so good we couldn't keep it from you any longer. This release is packed with quality of life improvements, and general bugfixes / stability. Deploy away!</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub <code>assign</code> command now automatically chooses the top issue and/or authenticated user if not provided.</li>
<li>The RSS feed connection no longer feels the need to spam you when GitHub fails to respond within 10s. It now waits for 30s.</li>
<li>Hookshot now supports creating GitLab connections without automatically provisioning a webhook. When this happens, the bot will tell you to talk to your admin to setup the webhook manually.</li>

<p>SchildiChat is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.5.8.sc62 of SchildiChat-Android got released this week, which adds a few new interesting features on top of Element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked reply rendering, to follow the rich replies specification. This improves the following:
<ul>
<li>Update the replied-to message in case the original message gets edited or deleted</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on desktop not being shown as replies on Android</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on Android being shown on Desktop with the replied-to event twice</li>
<li>Fix some weird rendering issues, like lists in a reply being completely broken</li>
<li>Nicer design, using the original sender's color, and a maximum height for the replied-to event</li>
<li>Render the replied-to event also for media replies, for example when the mautrix-telegram bridge sends an image reply</li>
<li>In the future, this will also allow us to render replied-to images instead of just writing "Image" in there, but this one is still on the TODO-list since I didn't want to delay a release further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Render captions as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530">MSC2530</a>.</li>
<li>We now allow sending all kinds of room-specific or account-specific global custom emotes as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">MSC2545</a> (but you still need to configure them with a different client before sending).</li>

<p>The last few weeks of Sliding Sync in the various mobile clients is showing its fruits: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">Sliding Sync offline caching and session recovery</a> was merged this week, giving you the latest state of your sliding sync in milliseconds without ever having touched the network now. You need to activate it via a setting on the SlidingSyncBuilder - FFI is exposed as well. This PR also adds recovery when the server rejected our request upon a failing position, indicating our session was reset. Previously, you needed to reconstruct the entire sliding-sync with all its state yourself, now this does it internally and transparently for the API user. Additionally, we merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1249">a fix for invited rooms</a>, which caused a panic on FFI usage, and have one other <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1248">fix to the sliding-sync state post cache coming up</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about fixes, the retry code path had a bug, which caused retries even when the API clearly stated we needed to change request, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">is fixed now</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1247">memory store won't continue to keep all media cached anymore</a>. More fixes are being pulled out of the demo branch and coming up as PRs next week.</p>

<h3 id="synapse-operator-for-kubernetes-website">Synapse Operator for Kubernetes (<a href="https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator">website</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mgoerens:matrix.org">mgoerens</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing a new way to run Synapse on top of Kubernetes !</p>
<p>The current capabilities of the Synapse Operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy Synapse: the operator can generate a default homeserver.yaml, or it can work with a custom homeserver.yaml, provided by the user.</li>
<li>Deploy the Heisenbridge and the mautrix-signal bridge: the operator automatically (re)configures Synapse to add the corresponding app_services.</li>
<li>Deploy a PostgreSQL database for Synapse (depends on the postgres-operator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the operator is deployed, the <code>Synapse</code> resource becomes available. Deploying a basic instance goes as simple as:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; synapse.yaml
</span><span>apiVersion: synapse.opdev.io/v1alpha1
</span><span>kind: Synapse
</span><span>metadata:
</span><span>  name: my-synapse
</span><span>spec:
</span><span>  homeserver:
</span><span>    values:
</span><span>      serverName: example.com
</span><span>      reportStats: true
</span><span>EOF
</span><span>$ kubectl apply -f synapse.yaml 
</span><span>synapse.synapse.opdev.io/my-synapse created
</span><span>$ kubectl get pods
</span><span>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span>my-synapse-84d56d54df-c699k   1/1     Running   0          63s
</span></code></pre>
<p>The operator takes care of the deployment and lifecycle management of the Synapse instance. Similarly, the <code>Heisenbridge</code> and <code>MautrixSignal</code> resources can also be deployed alongside Synapse and are managed by the operator.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator</a> is written in Go. To know more about the project, please visit https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator, there are explanations on how to deploy the operator, and examples demonstrating the main features. Or ping me on Matrix if you want to have a chat about it ! I'd love to collect some feedbacks !</p>

<p>Continued review on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> (extensions to <code>/send_join</code> for partial state) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3852">MSC3852</a> (user agent information on /devices) by the SCT was seen. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3743">MSC3743</a> (standard error responses for unknown endpoints) was also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1347">merged</a> to the unstable spec!</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3896">MSC3896: Appservice media</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC calls out the issue that today application services, especially those that bridge third-party networks, need to re-upload all bridged media to the homeserver in order for users to view it. This can create a large strain on disk resources for homeservers that bridge third-party networks and is a problem that is worth considering.</p>
<p>The approach the MSC takes to solving this is to allow application services to reserve an exclusive namespace for MXC URL's, such as <code>mxc://example.com/_discord_.*</code>. When a user's client attempted to request a media item that falls within the exclusive namespace, the homeserver would request the media from the application service (which in turn could pull it from the third-party network's CDN) rather than the homeserver's local media repo.</p>
<p>Seems like a cool idea! Check out the MSC and leave your thoughts if you're interested or have suggestions.</p>

<p>Postmoogle v0.9.9 is here!</p>
<p>The biggest release so far. Hmm... let me try again</p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> Biggest Release (so far)!</p>
<p>The last few weeks we at <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc</a> enhanced and optimized Postmoogle to make it as close to common email services as possible (it's not a full Gmail/Outlook/%You-name-it% replacement for a regular user yet, some features are missing, but we're pushing it towards that goal!)</p>
<p>The most notable changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic ban list (can be enabled by postmoogle admin) - no more nasty spammers will ever bother your host and if they will - Postmoogle will <del>cut the wires</del> drop TCP connections before even talking with them</li>
<li>automatic greylisting (can be configured by postmoogle admin) - good SMTP software must resend emails (and 99.99% of them do), RFC said.</li>
<li>internal email queue to re-send failed emails (with 45x errors) automatically - because Postmoogle is good SMTP software and it follows RFC</li>
<li>bridging email threads ‚áø matrix threads/reply-tos (for new emails) - that's a hard one. TL;DR: reply to email in matrix room (either by matrix thread or matrix reply-to) = email reply on email side, works both ways</li>
<li>multi-domain mode with the ability to select a domain for sending emails per room/per mailbox (all other domains will act as aliases)</li>
<li><code>!pm send</code> and thread replies send multipart emails by default (both HTML from formatted markdown and plaintext in the same email)</li>
<li>lots of other enhancements and fixes under the moogle</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed it has been a bit quiet from our side lately. Partially that is because I was just busy fixing issues in our new features on the Synapse side (or implementing MSCs in Synapse). But we also just have been fixing boring old issues in our project, that have been not annoying enough to get attention. For example there was a warning when configuring the project with CMake, which now shouldn't happen anymore, but also is just really boring to talk about.</p>
<p>So maybe some more exciting stuff, in theory, if your distribution builds curl with the correct flags, Nheko now supports connecting to servers over HTTP/3. This in itself is not that useful, but it might improve how Nheko behaves when switching connections or when using mobile data.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a completer for /commands (stuff like /me, /react or /sovietflip).</p>
<p>You can also now invert the Enter setting, so that you can send using Shift+Enter (thanks to LordMZTE) and you can update your status message over D-Bus (thanks LorenDB), which allows you to show what song you are listening to or what project you are working on, if you enable the D-Bus API and implement that as an addon in your music player or IDE.</p>
<p>Also lots of boring cleanups going on behind the scenes still, so expect cool stuff to be slower for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>It's been a busy week for the matrix-sdk team. As the week before, a lot of time was (well) spent on fixes and smaller improvements for mobile integration, during which a few bugs and problems where discovered and squashed. While this is ongoing, some of them already found their way back into mainline or at least have PRs pending for it: Like the bug in the read marker tracking which sometimes caused a crash <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1231">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1233">2</a>, a problem with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1235">timeline construction being async</a> or some minor fixes on the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1225">xtask for swift</a>. We've also noticed a significant regression in the automatic retry mechanism, which would just continue to spin for ever if the server gave a fully warranted error code back - if you experienced this, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">this PR should be solving it for you</a>.</p>
<p>A significant milestone was achieved this week on Async UniFFI. After getting a first PoC ready the week before, Ivan packaged it all up and sent <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">a draft PR upstream</a> with async python code calling an async rust code over FFI and interpreting the rusty result. So cool! Swift and kotlin targets are next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As that <a href="https://tobiasfella.de/posts/neochat-e2ee/">blog post</a> by Tobias mentions, releasing libQuotient 0.7 is the immediate next step - and in line with that, 0.7 RC has been published! Not much has changed since two betas; despite a very big piece of E2EE introduced in 0.7 release cycle, things have been mostly ironed out earlier in the year. Packagers are welcome to try their tools on the new release. Be mindful though that E2EE has just been introduced and wasn't widely tested; besides, a few pieces are still missing (read the blog post!); so while it's probably reasonable to switch E2EE on for packaging libQuotient, it's NOT recommended to do the same in client applications, unless accompanied by warnings and disclaimers all over the place. The <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7-rc">release notes</a> are still shallow and boring - the longer text will come with the final release.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received lots of optimizations to cut down playbook runtime, sponsored by the <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc managed Matrix hosting service</a>. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ansible">etke.cc Ansible playbook</a> (which is an extension of <code>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code>) is growing to support more and more services (besides just Matrix), so the Matrix playbook being leaner prevents runtimes from becoming too slow and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p>The playbook now runs about 2x-5x faster, thanks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>various optimizations (using <code>include_tasks</code> instead of <code>import_tasks</code> in all Ansible roles)</li>
<li>the introduction of additional install-only tags (<code>--tags=install-all</code> or <code>--tags=install-COMPONENT</code>) which skip slow and often unnecessary to run uninstall tasks</li>

<p>Hi everyone, we have released Mjolnir <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.1">v1.6.1</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>)</p>
<p>Which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always echo policy list changes. List changes are now always enabled, whereas before they where only shown with <code>config.verboseLogging</code>. Mjolnir now no longer hides changes made by the same mjolnir account, providing the user with feedback for changes they have made to policy lists after using the ban/unban commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy lists created by mjolnir will now be done so with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784">MSC3784</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mjolnir now supports specifying the config file with the argument <code>--mjolnir-config</code>. It is highly recommended that you do this as opposed to relying on the environment variable <code>NODE_ENV</code>. The documentation for running with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_docker.md">docker</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_selfbuild.md">source</a> have been updated accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the WordList protection which was matching every message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework the banning and unbanning of entities in PolicyLists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unbanning no longer searches for rules by <code>state_key</code> but by entity.</li>
<li>Users with longer mxids can now be banned.</li>
<li>Mjolnir no longer waits for the next client sync before applying server ACL and member bans after using the ban command</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the clarity of the unban command. Users marked as banned by the <code>Flooding</code> and <code>FirstMessageIsMedia</code> protections can now be unbanned with the ban command. Using the unban command without <code>true</code> will now warn the user that room level bans will not be overridden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced <code>acceptInvitesFromGroup</code> with <code>acceptInvitesFromSpace</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>config.protectAllJoinedRooms</code> leaking into explicitly protected rooms and mjolnir trying to protect watched lists in some circumstances. You would only have been impacted by this if you ran <code>latest</code>.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-v1-5">Matrix v1.5</h3>
<p>Matrix v1.5 was released on November 17th, 2022! üéâ</p>
<p>While not as feature-packed as previous releases (v1.5 was intended as a maintenance release), it's still worth checking out! Included are two new MSCs that have landed, as well as loads of little bugfixes and clarifications to the spec text itself. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aclarification+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E2022-10-01">all who helped fix issues</a> since v1.4!</p>

<h3 id="extensible-events-are-shaping-up">Extensible Events are Shaping Up!</h3>
<p>As may be apparent from the new MSCs this week, the SCT has been looking at extensible events to iron out some of the finer details of the system. They're not necessarily in the best position to review at the moment, but keep an eye on this space for when review would be most welcome üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2705">MSC2705: Animated thumbnails for media (and thumbnail content-type requirements)</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define a method for clients to indicate to their homeserver that they would like to have animated version if possible when requesting a thumbnail of some media. This would allow clients to provide a toggle to the user for whether media in the timeline should be animated, or whether room and user avatars should be animated, etc. Potentially separate options for each!</p>
<p>Today, there is no way for the client to indicate per-request whether they would like to receive an animated version of a thumbnail. This leaves the choice up to the homeserver, which gives individual users much less control.</p>
<p>The MSC also defines mimetypes that animated thumbnails should return. And it has an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>!</p>
<p>Check it out if animated avatars/thumbnails peaks your interest.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding experimental support for MSC3912: Relation-based redactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding an Admin API endpoint for user lookup based on third-party ID (3PID).</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>Populus viewer now supports .well-known discovery, so you just need to know your matrix server name, rather than the full subdomain in order to connect.</li>
<li>Populus viewer now supports the "restricted" join rule for annotations, so that annotation membership can be restricted to members of the underlying resource space. This will likely be the default for newly created annotations in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our server (at populus.open-tower.com) has also been rebuilt and reconfigured a bit, and will likely be converted from a test-bed to a stable home for annotation-based discussions in the coming weeks.

<p><a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript with the promise that their generated JS code will <em>NEVER</em> raise any runtime errors and show high performance.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that certain implementations like <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Chat</a> already <a href="https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client">use Elm</a>, I could not find an SDK for it. That's why I've started to write one: https://git.noordstar.me/bram/Elm-Matrix</p>
<p>The SDK is currently in early development. The <code>/v3/sync</code> endpoint is functional and there are already a few other ways to interact with the API, so the repository can already be tested by developers who are familiar with Elm. If you aren't that familiar with the language, it is better to wait until I release the first complete version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trinity is an experimental bot framework written in Rust and using matrix-rust-sdk, as well as
commands / modules compiled to WebAssembly, with convenient developer features like modules
hot-reload.</p>
<p>Two weeks of updates, because I've been slightly late last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinity now uses WebAssembly components as created with
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component"><code>cargo-components</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen"><code>wit-bindgen</code></a> under the hood for the Matrix
modules. This is quite experimental and early stage, but this allows multiple exciting things in
some not-so-distant future: switch API implementations at runtime, more security by isolating
specific APIs, using source languages for the modules that can be compiled with wit-bindgen, etc.</li>
<li>In particular, we've made a proof-of-concept for a bot module written in C (!) and compiled to
WebAssembly, and we've been very close to having a bot module written in Java using the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">TeaVM</a> project.</li>
<li>New APIs have been added for the modules:
<ul>
<li>a simple key-value store, that is backed by the <a href="https://github.com/cberner/redb/">redb</a> pure
Rust project, which comes with great performance.</li>
<li>modules can now specific help messages as well as admin commands (that will be available only
to a predefined admin user).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which then allowed to write a shiny new Mastodon module: configure it in a room with a set of
credentials, a Mastodon URL instance, define which users are allowed to use it, and then post
statuses from the room using <code>!toot message</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Major breakthroughs have happened behind the scenes this week: we were able to get a simple python3-asyncio to poll our rust-side future and receive its result via uniffi. While there isn't much to show for the outside world, this is a major step towards having async-uniffi. The team is super excited about this development.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Sliding-Sync-Land, we have debugged the session reset and added <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">transparent session recovery to the offline-caching PR</a>. Together with the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1219">PR that hands over the already received timeline events to the new Timeline API</a>, this should visibly speed up things and improve overall performance across all major clients using both of these. Further more, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1215">Timeline API has UTD decryption retry support</a> now. The client interfaces are moving ahead fast.</p>

                <p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever
Matrix.org Foundation and Community devroom <em>in person</em> at FOSDEM. Half a day of
talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of
Matrix.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open
source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk
about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are
not welcome.</p>
<p>This call for participation is only about the physical devroom. A separate CfP
will be issued for the online devroom once there are more details about it.</p>
<p>Key dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference dates 4-5 February, 2023 In person</li>
<li>Matrix Devroom date: Sunday 5 morning in person, online devroom to be
announced</li>
<li>Submission deadline: Monday 5th December</li>
<li>Announcement of selected talks: Thursday 15th December</li>
</ul>
<p>You must be available in person to present your talk for the physical devroom.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks can follow one of thee two formats for the physical devroom</p>
<ul>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can
actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open
Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of
your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as
all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a>
before <del>December 5</del> December 8 2022. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can
follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom
organisers will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the
potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the
Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it
has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>
Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>
