  My client is non-idle, and is foregrounded, and i'm typing in the room.

  However whenever anyone says anything, I get it also relayed as a desktop notification.

  This is Really Annoying,

    Chrome has a big bug in Linux where being minimised does not trigger hidden = true. This has been fixed in an unreleased version. 

    I had to decide whether to always show notifications (ensuring even if minimised you wouldn't miss anything) or using the hidden var and risk people not being notified. I went with the former.

    I've just reverted to the original behaviour of only issuing notifications if document.hidden == true... or your presence is idle because you haven't interacted with the app for a few minutes.

    This is far better than notifying for everything - even when the window is in the foreground, especially if you are binging on everything that happens.

    We clearly have hugely different ideas of how desktop notifications should work.  I expect the common case is to notify you whenever anything happens in any of your channels - just like iMessage/Blah/WhatsApp etc notify you whenever anything happens in any chat.  You can then refine the notifs with bingwords if you so desire.

    This means the default behaviour is to bing on everything - which means that you *really* don't want it binging on everything when you actually are using the app in the foreground!

    I understand the difference in worldview now, but I think we should avoid changing existing behaviour of features which work without some consultation with whoever wrote them, otherwise users will see features mysteriously flapping around and consider it flakiness.
