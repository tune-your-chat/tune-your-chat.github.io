  The current failure message is a very non-obvious complaint that '@' isn't a valid user identifer. This fails because of the implementation quirk in Python that any string is iterable as a list of one-character substrings.

  Ideally, a invite "list" of a single string should instead return an error message to the effect that it was expecting a list, got a string. That would immediately alert the unwary client developer to this fact.
