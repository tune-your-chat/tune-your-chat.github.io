    Here is the guide: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-fdroiddata-and-submitting-apps
    Needs some project management authority to decide on the values.

    Hearing increasing requests for this from the FOSS community, e.g.:

    @alexl:matrix.org
    Great! But ouch it's not available on F-droid
    Instead Telegram does...

    I looked at this. Two problems currently: we use google play-services-gcm and google analytics. F-droid doesn't support proprietary software. For analytics it looks like we could just add https://github.com/mar-v-in/NoAnalytics instead, but AFAIK there's no good alternative for GCM. We could make it optional, but that'd be more work than just not including the library. 

    Gradle lets you add flavors of your app, so we could have one "foss" and one "standard" (with google deps). (see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18196974/how-to-define-different-dependencies-for-different-product-flavors and https://github.com/openrightsgroup/Android-Probe/issues/2)

    There certainly seems like a need for a good foss chat platform. Interestingly, TextSecure decided *not* to distribute on f-droid: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/127

  body: can't we just disable GCM and fall back to the behaviour of chewing CPUblike we used to before we had GCM?

    Not sure about disabling while building, but the notifications should be functional on devices w/o gapps after SYAND-140 is closed (which seems pretty close as of writing).

    Also,
    > Interestingly, TextSecure decided not to distribute on f-droid
    So, unofficial builds have appeared:

    - https://github.com/JavaJens/TextSecure
