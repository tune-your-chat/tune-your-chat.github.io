  I'd like Google to be able to index public matrix rooms easily (unless people flag them as do-not-index) - this makes the valuable information in scrollback much more accessible, and makes it feel more like a mailing list substitute.  From a marketing-Matrix perspective this is fairly important.

  This requires:
   * Defining do-not-index state for a room, and honouring it with robots.txt or user-agent analysis or similar
   * Supporting anonymous accounts
   * Ensuring that page contents is navigable and paginatable (might involve turning off angular if we detect a search engine user agent)
   * Ideally we'd also expose per-message URIs to make content more findable, too.

  body: We would need to make public channels read-only without an {{access_token}}. I was under the impression we thought about this and decided against it?

  body: I don't remember us deciding against it - meanwhile, we're seeing more requests for read-only clients (e.g. from randy@vuc, and si-m1).  At least being able to support anonymous sign-in with read-only semantics for public rooms feels like a really useful thing to be able to do.
