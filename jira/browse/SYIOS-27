  First time you ever launch the app, we should be on the "Home" tab (which should probably be renamed "Room List" or similar).

  After the user has actually joined some rooms, then subsequent launches should surely default to the "Recents" tab.

  We should load the Recents tab as quickly as possible from the mxstore cache (albeit with a spinner whilst the eventstream catches up), to let the user jump quickly to the room they are interested in (even if the eventstream is still catching up)

    A first change has been done in order to launch the app on Recents tab for logged user.

    We still need to rename "Home" tab, suggested label is: "Rooms" (but I'm not convinced).
    A change at SDK level is required to speed up Recents tab loading (see SYIOS-26)
