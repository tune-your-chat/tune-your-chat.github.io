                <p>We're proud to announce <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> is the first member to join
the Foundation! Beeper is a universal chat app, built on top of Matrix. Beeper
is strongly committing to support Matrix by becoming the first member in the
Gold tier as well.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-is-a-strategic-choice">Matrix is a strategic choice</h2>
<p>Beeper allows you to connect accounts from up to 15 different chat platforms to
get a unified inbox in a single app. The core business of Beeper is to provide a
polished app and service to their users. Beeper is built upon Matrix: behind the
scenes, a Beeper account is a Matrix account on the Beeper homeserver, and the
company hosts bridges for its users. The experience is completely transparent
for them.</p>
<p>Matrix was an obvious choice in Beeper's stack because of its interoperable
nature. <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/">Bridges</a> are the core of
Beeper's business: they are the most active bridges maintainer of the Matrix
ecosystem, and most of them are open source too. It makes a lot of sense for
Beeper to build on top of Matrix so they don't have to reinvent the wheel:
homeservers exist, the AppService API that allows them to create bridges exists,
and maintaining an in-house solution for this all would cost more than their
contribution to Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix also solves the difficult problem of End-to-Bridge Encryption: it allows
bridges to decrypt messages from a third party platform like WhatsApp and
re-encrypt it for Matrix users. This makes the homeserver completely oblivious
to the content of the messages. It protects customers against passive leaks, and
the most privacy conscious ones can even <a href="https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager">self-host their bridges</a>
to get total control of the messages making it through.</p>
<h2 id="mission-aligned">Mission aligned</h2>
<p>Beyond the obvious business choice of relying on Matrix, Beeper and the
Foundation have a lot of values in common. The Foundation is fighting for
interoperability possible at a technical level‚Ä¶ but it's also fighting to make
it possible at a legal and systemic level. We've been very vocal in the Digital
Markets Act discussions In Europe. Beeper's CEO Eric Migicovsky also took part
in the consultation launched by the EU in the hopes of opening up the walled
gardens of <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en#who-are-the-gatekeepers">Gatekeepers</a>.
The regulation change brought by the DMA will accelerate the adoption of
interoperability across the board, bringing the tools to make it sustainable and
reliable, which is a direct business enabler for Beeper.</p>
<h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>
<p>We once again welcome Beeper and congratulate them for being the first member to
support the stack they rely on! As for organisations who depend on Matrix: we
still need your support to make Matrix sustainable.</p>
<p>Join us in our mission to make Matrix the ubiquitous foundation for respectful
products and services, <a href="https://matrix.org/membership">become a member today</a>!</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This actually happened last week, but a huge shoutout to K√©vin Commaille, aka <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>, for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1310">their work on upgrading the OpenAPI schema data</a> for the Matrix Spec to version 3.1. This schema describes all of the requests and responses for all endpoints in the spec, as well as various event types and other bits and pieces. It directly powers the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/">Matrix spec website</a>, the <a href="https://playground.matrix.org/#overview">Matrix API Playground</a> and several Client and Homeserver SDKs that generate code from it.</p>
<p>With a diff of <code>+14,997 ‚àí12,660</code>, this was a multi-month effort of both implementation and review (thank you <a href="https://github.com/richvdh">@richvdh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal">@KitsuneRal</a>!). This change will allow us to use all the new features that OpenAPI 3 has to offer, as well as generally keeps us up to date with modern tooling.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3051">MSC3051: A scalable relation format</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC describes a different way of describing how an event relates to other events. In the current Matrix spec, you can use <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#forming-relationships-between-events">the <code>m.relates_to</code> property</a> to indicate that this event (say, a reaction) relates to another event (say, a message) in a certain manner. You can specify how it relates using the <code>m.relates_to-&gt;rel_type</code> key; a value of "m.annotation" for reactions.</p>
<p>But sometimes you may want to relate to multiple other events. For instance, what if that message you're reacting to is also in a thread? In fact, this MSC has come up recently as one possible way to solve the problem of efficiently discerning whether an event should belong in a thread or not (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4023#discussion_r1211964051">discussion</a>). This MSC isn't the only option for solving such a problem - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4023">MSC4023</a> would also work, and both have tradeoffs.</p>
<p>MSC3051 could also allows for actions such as editing replies; both the text and the message it was a reply to. Neat!</p>
<p>Do read the MSC and give feedback if relations is something that excites you.</p>

                <p>Hello federation,</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: New website is coming tomorrow, your RSS reader might be disoriented during the switch.</strong></p>
<p>That's right, after several months of studying, designing and implementing: we're finally going to deploy the new matrix.org website on June 16! Let's have a look back at the why and how.</p>
<p>I also need to thank Jonas Platte not only for his technical expertise but also for his kind support and patience. Thanks to MTRNord as well for kickstarting the project, and to the various designers involved.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>On the Spec Core Team (SCT), we've started converting the list of MSCs we received into a roadmap for the next 8-ish weeks. This is all to prepare for Matrix 1.8, and we're already starting to think a bit about what Matrix 1.9 looks like too. You can see what the team plans to look at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88">here</a> - each column is ordered in relative priority, where the top is more likely to receive attention first. Not everything is actionable at the moment, but that's the point üòÑ As we work through the next month or so, the remaining MSCs should be unblocked or near-unblocked enough to allow the SCT to make progress on them.</p>
<p>Most of the MSCs on the roadmap have a target state of acceptance (and merge, if we can make that happen), though some do have a simple task of reviewing the MSC ahead of implementation effort. We're aiming to test this process over the next few releases, where the SCT unblocks progress by providing review ahead of review actually being needed, but to do that we need to know what people plan to work on. If you have something which could do with review (not just acceptance) in the August-November window of time, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>.</p>
<p>As always, if you have questions about a particular MSC's state or what this process actually means, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SCT is continuing its IETF/MIMI adventures by pushing Linearized Matrix towards working group adoption. The current stages involve updating the Internet-Draft (I-D, or MSC in IETF terms) to cover the MIMI-specific bits of the room model and working on multiple implementations of the proposal. We'll be updating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">the MSC</a> at a later stage to account for the DAG interop components, though how to get a DAG to work with the linear, append-only, MIMI variant is very much top of mind. You can see the current rapidly-changing I-D <a href="https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-linearized-matrix/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned, to further adoption of Linearized Matrix within MIMI we're looking for independent implementations. "Independent" here means not written by the Matrix Core Team and not written by Element given the potential for conflict of interest, though the Matrix team is working on proving the I-D through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server">eigen-server</a> and possibly a dual-stack Synapse (watch this space). We have a line on ~2 completely independent (but undisclosed üòá) Linearized Matrix implementations already, but more is often better for these things: if you work for a messaging service provider and are interested in writing an implementation, <a href="mailto:draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix@ietf.org?subject=Mail%20regarding%20draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix">get in touch</a> with us so we can coordinate some interop testing. You don't already have to be using Matrix to write an implementation, and in fact it's probably better if you aren't already using Matrix, awkwardly.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The script of fate has decided to put forward <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3060">MSC3060: Room Labels</a> this week. This is a relatively small MSC, but one which provides a ton of value to discovering rooms. The labels/topics your room covers are listed in a state event and can inform users of what to expect beyond the room name/avatar. For example, if your room has primarily NSFW/18+ content, you can disclose that in the labels.</p>
<p>Leave your thoughts and concerns on the MSC via threads on the diff üôÇ</p>

<p>Part of the SCT's goals with Matrix 1.8 is to pre-plan the majority of our review attention, which means we need to be told what folks are working on to plan accordingly. We'll still have some room for random/surprise MSC work, but this is expected to be harder to acquire going forward (and so should not be relied upon).</p>
<p>Please let us know if you're working on something which affects the spec! We want to hear about:</p>
<ul>
<li>things that aren't MSCs (yet)</li>
<li>things that are MSCs but aren't planned to be merged in 1.8</li>
<li>MSCs which are expected to be ready in time for Matrix 1.8 (in ~2 months)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren't sure if your project affects the spec, talk to us about it. We do not want to be the bottleneck in your development cycle, instead preferring to know ahead of time that something will need attention from us.</p>
<p>All we need is for you to mention your project/MSC and timeline in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> - DMs and private rooms with SCT members are not enough to get something on the roadmap. This is to ensure there is full transparency in why the SCT is looking at something, and to ensure that the MSC moves through the process in an efficient manner. If your project has a sensitive context (commercial or otherwise), then we ask that you reference that here and someone from the team will contact you to get more information, relaying as much (non-sensitive) detail as possible back to the room here.</p>
<p>Our expected outcome for this system is to not only be a more effective team, but also to give you a faster/more reasonable turnaround on MSC review (at all stages), more rapid deployment of stable features (dropping unstable prefixes), and overall fewer review iterations as the SCT can think about problems ahead of you actually needing a review. We seriously do not want to be a blocker, but we need to know what we could end up blocking by accident.</p>
<p>Starting approximately August 1st, we will be starting to plan out what Matrix 1.9's release cycle will look like. A similar call to action will be raised at that point. Note that Matrix 1.8 is set to be released in late August, meaning we're aiming to have Matrix 1.9 thought out before Matrix 1.8 is released, which is a deliberately accelerated timeline than the current Matrix 1.8 release cycle planning.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions about this, please let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3869">MSC3869: Read event relations with the Widget API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow Matrix Widgets, knowing an event ID, to request any and all other events that relate to it. Thus, if you had a <code>m.room.message</code> event, you could ask the client whether any edits have been made to that event, via asking for <code>m.room.message</code> events with <code>m.replace</code> relations.</p>
<p>This would be useful for Widgets to traverse any data structure that used relations to tie together events - which could model all sorts of use cases!</p>
<p>As always, leave your feedback on the MSC if this is something you're interested in or want to push forwards :)</p>

<p>There is currently a client-side implementation for this MSC, but it is missing a homeserver side one (for adding the push rule).</p>

<p>In other news, the next release of the spec, v1.7, is coming up in the not-too-distant future. In keeping with our roughly quarterly release schedule - the release of v1.6 was on February 14th, 2023 - a new release of the spec should come some time in next few weeks.</p>
<p>We haven't set a date yet, but expect to do so soon. So watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3741">MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC fixes an edge case in the spec. Imagine the following scenario. You're logged into your homeserver via an SSO flow (let's say by signing into GitLab), and then you try to change your password on GitLab. Doing so may cause a "soft logout" to occur for your Matrix client. A soft logout, by the way, happens when your access token is invalidated, but your client is told explicitly not to wipe its local state (including encryption keys).</p>
<p>Your Matrix client is telling you to log back in again, and in doing so calls out to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3login"><code>GET /_matrix/client/v3/login</code></a> endpoint to see what login methods are available. Your homeserver supports both password-based and SSO-based login, so that's what you get back. Your client happily presents you both options. You try to type your GitLab password, but it's incorrect. And you've just given your GitLab password to this Matrix homeserver in plaintext - oh no!</p>
<p>The problem here stems from the fact that <code>GET /login</code> is unauthenticated. The homeserver doesn't know who you are when you attempt to log in again, and thus can't tailor the available login methods to those that make sense for you. This MSC aims to fix this by having your Matrix client, upon trying to learn how to log in again after a soft logout, provide your expired access token in an <code>Authorization</code> request header. The homeserver can then check and see that 1) you were just soft logout'd and 2) you are an account that is authorised via SSO - so it doesn't make sense to suggest you log in again via a password specific to your Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p>While this MSC discusses a valuable solution, it is worth considering that the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api">User-Interactive Authentication system</a> as a whole is going to be completely replaced by OpenID Connect instead, which will make this problem (and solution) moot. Still, that day is not here yet, so if you suffer from this problem today, this may be one method to deal with it.</p>

<p>Some of you might have heard of it, but we're about to launch a (long overdue) update of the matrix.org website! The current one has served us well, but it grew organically as exciting projects and features were added to it. It became a little impractical to navigate and sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The new matrix.org website, nicknamed "Zola" <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">after the static site generator it uses</a>, is not just a fresh coat of paint on the website: it's a complete rewrite to address three kind of people who would browse the website. Sorted by time they're willing to spend on a web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general public, who is not tech savvy and doesn't want to understand how things work, but who wants to get an easy onboarding</li>
<li>Community managers, who are not <em>too</em> tech savvy but are willing to spend a bit of time to understand more advanced use cases</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand how matrix works, and who want to build &amp; break things!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're in the final stages of developing the website, and <em>we need you</em> to help us making it ready! Head to <a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/">the preview of the website</a>, use the website, and give is feedback by opening <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues">an issue on the website tracker</a>. Please make sure the issue doesn't <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Azola">already exist before opening it</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting the following is particularly helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something looks off, misplaced, is not aligned well or behaves oddly</li>
<li>Something is missing (the doc is incomplete? Some informationg is missing somewhere?)</li>
<li>There's an accessibility issue</li>
<li>Something doesn't work on your browser</li>
<li>It's not clear how to get to a particular information (you're looking for a client or a SDK, and after visiting the website you still don't know which one to use or how to get it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish up the Bots page (which will likely be replaced by an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/1539#issuecomment-1444180681">Integrations</a> page)</li>
<li>Flesh out the support page to highlight more of the work of the Matrix.org Foundation</li>
<li>Import the historical projects that are no longer maintained (clients, servers, bots, bridges, sdks)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to follow along, you can join the #matrix.org-website:matrix.org room.</p>
<p>Help us make the website look as neat as possible for launch!</p>

<p>The UK's online safety bill is a catastrophe in the making, and as currently written empowers the UK telecoms industry regulator (OFCOM) to obligate end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to embed proprietary 3rd party scanning software which attempts to identify and flag abusive content and report it to the authorities. <strong>If you are in the UK, please sign this petition https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/634725 to try to force the government to reconsider</strong>.
