  The first /sync, initialSync, implicitly sends presences of all online users.
  This allows to be in-sync about all online users. This is currently the only way to get this information.

  But a (mobile) client that has a resume capability avoids to do initialSync. Thus, it cannot know who is online on a resume and displays wrong presence values.

  It would be nice to have mechanism to get all online users presences.
  Mark suggested:
   - Maybe if we added a filtering mechanism to the full_state flag we might be able to do something nicer here?
   - Or just added another flag to /sync like the full_state flag?
   - Or extended /sync to make it possible to submit a separate request to get the missing presence?
