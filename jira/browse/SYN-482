  After joining an IRC one to one channel, the initial sync request triggers by "api/v1/rooms/[roomId]/initialSync" with a limit =10 provides only one event as "messages" whereas there are more than 3 messages in the chat.

  For information:
  1-  "history_visibility" = invited;
  2- the messages show up if we hit the /messages API

  To reproduce:
  1- From IRC chat, userA select a userB to open a dialog window (no one to one channel must exist for these 2 users).
  2 - In irc window userA sends 3 messages.
  3- on a Matrix client, userB selects the invitation from recents
  --> userB join the room and trigger an initialSync for this room
  Presently the room history is not provided during the room initial sync: NOK

  body: If I recall correctly I had a go at fixingthis by making room initialSync do backfill, but then [~erikj] talked me out of it because it might cause problems if the server started backfilling without a client explicitly asking for it by hitting /messages.

  body: After discussing this with [~erikj] we decided to not make initialSync hit backfill messages, therefore it is expected that initialSync and messages will return different things
