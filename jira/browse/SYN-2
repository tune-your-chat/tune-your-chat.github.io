  Rooms currently can never ben destroyed from the room list.  So if someone accidentally creates ##sillyname:matrix.org:matrix.org or something similarly embarassing, there's no way to edit the directory to remove the alias.

  We should support this asap to let people clean up their mistakes.

  body: Should there be permissions locking down who can do this? If I create an alias, does that mean only I can delete it? What's stopping people from modifying existing aliases to point to !nasty_room_id:matrix.org ?

  body: Yes, it needs a permission.  Surely the matrixy way to do this is to define a threshold powerlevel for a room beyond which you're allowed to diddle its alias.

  body: Aliases are completely separate from the room itself. I can create aliases for a room I'm not even in.

  body: Well, we surely don't want to have a totally separate ACL system for aliases.  Can't we mandate that HSes only let you create aliases for rooms which you are in, and the powerlevel of the person who created an aliases is stored and replicated over that room, and can only be edited by people with higher powerlevel?

    The problem is that they are two completely different systems. Room state != Directory server data. As I said on IRC:
    {quote}
    <kegan> #room:nastydomain.com is free to point at whatever the hell it likes, nastydomain.com doesn't need to be running a HS, and the room ID it points to will have no idea I've pointed to it.

  body: Have split out the wider permissions discussion into SYN-66.  SYN-2 remains as the functional bug.

    A first cut on this would be to just have the server admin responsible for doing so - although in practice they can do that already by just editing the table in sqlite on the HS in question.

    Having it self-service would be much nicer...
