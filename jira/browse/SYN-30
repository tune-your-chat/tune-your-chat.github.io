  body: |-
    i'm assuming that the client should hit a given URL every N seconds whilst someone is typing
    If the user deletes what they were typing, the URL should be reset.
    If the user stops typing, the client just stops sending updates
    meanwhile the server times out and resets the state & URL after M seconds of idle
    The client tells the server the value of M it should be using to time out the requests.
    the proposal on https://etherpad.openmarket.com/SynapseTodo was:

    - PUT or GET /members/rooms/$roomid/members/$userid/typing  { timeout: M } 

    and a {} to reset

    Leo: all I need from you then is to implement that URL, persisting it to DB and propagating it as an EDU to all the members of a room - sending it only once when someone starts typing, and once when the reset state happens.
    ...and in the event of a HS<->HS connection timing out, reset all the typing notifs from the lost HS
    ...and in the event of M seconds expiring, resetting specific typing notif state.

  body: The path seems weird, I would prefer parity with the other APIs, so something like /rooms/$roomid/typing for the RPC-like API and /rooms/$roomid/state/m.room.typing/$userid for the state event+key. I'm happy with the content.
