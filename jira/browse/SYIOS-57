  Steps to reproduce:
   - create a self chat
   - post more than 10 messages
   - restart the app
   - come back to the room
   - paginate back

  -> Pagination will take ages - the UI is even frozen sometimes. When the loading wheel disappears, no older messages appear.
  If you press the screen to see messages timestamps, the older messages appear.
