  Hello - I see that I can set rooms so they do not appear in the room list for a given homeserver. 

  One fairly large issue for companies trying to use a Synapse Homeserver with a Vector client, yet needing to keep names of rooms private, is that the "room list" is all or nothing. 

  We can toggle room listing to off for all rooms, but, how does that work for a situation in which, we also want to have privacy. For example: 

  If I have rooms to provide support for CLIENT-A and CLIENT-B, I want to be able to conveniently open them, but, I don't want users in the CLIENT-A org to see CLIENT-B's room. 

  Is there a way to make this work? I think we can simply provide an URL to our clients, but it would be a pain to maintain that, for internal people. 

  Ideas appreciated.

    [~rickcogley]: the ORG project is for issues about the websites and a few bits of matrix.org infrastructure.

    The best place to discuss your situation would probably be Matrix HQ.
