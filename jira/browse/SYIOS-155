  In case of successful login, the hostname of the server is provided in server response thanks to key named 'home_server' (https://matrix.org/docs/spec/#login).

  This hostname is presently ignored by MatrixSDK. Indeed the 'homeserver' field defined in MXCredentials object is used to store the server url.

  Support hostname in MXCredentials object implies to refactor the field 'homeserver'. CAUTION: this refactoring impacts the existing credentials stored on device. A patch must be implemented to guarantee the backward compatibility.
