  It would be really nice to distinguish recents entries based on:
   * Has a binger gone off there since you last checked?  (room title could be blue?)
   * Has the history changed since you last checked? (room title could be red like xchat, or perhaps just highlight the background colour slightly?)
   * Is it a pending invite?  Could be shown the same as the above.
