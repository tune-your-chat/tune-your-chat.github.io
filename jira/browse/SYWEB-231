  The new content repo has landed, and is docced currently mainly at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/synapse/media/v1/media_repository.py#L28

  We should switch to using it asap.  This means:
   * Using relative rather than absolute URLs in the events
   * Not bothering to generate client-side thumbnails, as the quality serverside is hopefully better
   * Displaying thumbnails using the thumbnails API

  Does this mean we should kill off the thumbnail_url field entirely from events?

    In the interests of including as much info as possible, this is what the API for the "new content repo" is:
    {code}
    File uploading and downloading.
        Uploads are POSTed to a resource which returns a token which is used to GET
        the download::
            => POST /_matrix/media/v1/upload HTTP/1.1
               Content-Type: <media-type>
               <media>
            <= HTTP/1.1 200 OK
               Content-Type: application/json
               { "content-uri": "mxc://<server-name>/<media-id>" }
            => GET /_matrix/media/v1/download/<server-name>/<media-id> HTTP/1.1
            <= HTTP/1.1 200 OK
               Content-Type: <media-type>
               Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=<upload-filename>
               <media>
        Clients can get thumbnails by supplying a desired width and height and
        thumbnailing method::
            => GET /_matrix/media/v1/thumbnail/<server_name>
                    /<media-id>?width=<w>&height=<h>&method=<m> HTTP/1.1
            <= HTTP/1.1 200 OK
               Content-Type: image/jpeg or image/png
               <thumbnail>
        The thumbnail methods are "crop" and "scale". "scale" trys to return an
        image where either the width or the height is smaller than the requested
        size. The client should then scale and letterbox the image if it needs to
        fit within a given rectangle. "crop" trys to return an image where the
        width and height are close to the requested size and the aspect matches
        the requested size. The client should scale the image if it needs to fit
        within a given rectangle.
    {code}
