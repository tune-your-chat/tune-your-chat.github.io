  Currently the (i) button on iOS takes us to a *really* ugly contact list for the channel.

   * Rather than horizontal bars for power levels, we could consider using mini pie-charts like on iOS.  Or just a number would be less ugly.
   * Rather than age-on-green, we could put a presence circle round the avatar for consistency on web client.
   * We have no option to start a conversation with a user as selected from the contact list.
   * On iPhone 6+ (iOS 8.1), the list doesn't take up the whole page and leaves a weird greyed out ugly space at the bottom.
   * We surely shouldn't be showing left users at all (other than as a debugging option in settings)
