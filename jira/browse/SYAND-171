  I noticed that push notifications on Android seemed to be rather flakey. Sometimes I would get pushed. Sometimes I would not get pushed. I spent this morning trying to reproduce the bug in controlled circumstances and have now succeeded.

  This was reproduced on build {{develop-288}}.

  Repro steps:
   - Open the app.
   - With a *different* account, send a message to the android app. Make sure it is received. Everything is normal.
   - Close the app by pressing the HOME button.
   - Run {{adb logcat -v time | grep -Ei "onMessage|catchup"}} - The purpose of this command is to tail the logs and pick out when the android app receives a push notification ({{GcmListenerServer: onMessageReceived}}, and when the catchup is initiated {{MXSession: catchupEventStream}}).
   - Change the network the android device is on to a *slow* network else you'll never kill the connection in time.
   - With the *different* account, send a message with a bing word (e.g. mention the android user's name).
   - Watching the output of logcat, immediately kill the wifi/mobile data connection the moment {{onMessageReceived}} is logged. You need to be fast.
   - If you did it correctly, the notification will *not appear*. This is expected because the catchup request didn't succeed. This is not a bug.
   - Now, open the app. The message mentioning the user should not be present.
   - Close the app by pressing the HOME button.
   - Re-enable the network connection (full speed).
   - No notification ever appears, even though logcat indicates that a catchup is indeed being performed. This is the bug.

  Notes:
   - You *must* open the app the 2nd time else this bug will not occur.
   - I've tried these repro steps a few times now and it is 100% reliable.

    This issue appears to be here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/matrix-sdk/src/main/java/org/matrix/androidsdk/util/BingRulesManager.java#L84
    When `getAllBingRules` fails, `isReady` isn't set to true again. This should be an easy fix
