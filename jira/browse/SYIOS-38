  When I set an avatar and displayname for the first time, it's very unclear as to when the avatar actually get sets set. When I uploaded the avatar everything seemed okay, but on setting a display name, it flickered on and off, appeared with the wrong orientation, and then reappeared correctly again.

  Either we need to submit avatar & displayname changes immediately, or go back to having a formal "Update" button on the UI for saving either.

  This contradicts my previous suggestion that we should somehow automatically apply displayname changes rather than having an explicit Save button - apologies; i'm a crank...
