description: |-
  Users may wish to permanently delete a conversation from the list of rooms that comes down in /initialSync.

  This should be a permanent operation, it should not be possible to recover the room. Otherwise this is just a special case of the filtering the room list.

  If all users on an HS have deleted the room, then that room may be deleted from the HS.
