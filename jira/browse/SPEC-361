  It would be useful if a client can distinguish at a glance of the members list (i.e. the set of {{m.room.member}}) events which users are guests, which are ghosts of which ASes, etc...

  One way that this could be done easily is by adding another profile-like field, to be supplied along with the {{displayname}} and {{avatar_url}} fields there.

  body: Yup. this could be done by extensible profile data, namespaced to the bridge itself, but i'm a bit worried that it's trivially spoofable and unnecessarily 'magic'.  It feels slightly nicer to me if the AS was to 'sign' the user into participating in a given usergroup - i believe Erik's plan for user groups is some kind of crypto-based mechanism where the group owner signs the members to prove their membership.  Then there's no spoofing, and we can put whatever metadata we like on the group itself?
