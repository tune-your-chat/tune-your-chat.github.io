<p>In this new segment, we aim to give a bit more context as to why an MSC was opened, beyond what is available in the MSC's introduction.</p>
<p>MSC4056 stems from a conversation held back at IETF 117, where members of the Spec Core Team (SCT) were attempting to make RBAC work in Matrix. Thankfully, there was prior art in the form of MSC2812, but a problem with decentralization (and specifically state resolution) was discovered. Thoughts were had about how to fix it, and MSC4056 is the result of those thoughts. Implementation work is eventually planned for this MSC, but in the meantime it should see forwards movement with the SCT's involvement in the MIMI working group at the IETF.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts or suggestions about the very Discord-centric approach, please leave them on the MSC :)</p>

<p>We‚Äôd like to thank everyone for their patience as we continue to work toward restoring the Libera.Chat bridge, and apologize for the continued inconvenience. We‚Äôve heard from many people and communities who are impacted, who have confirmed that operating this bridge is an important service and we remain committed to getting it back online.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been a month since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/libera-bridge-disabled/">our last update</a> and folks have been reaching out, so we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a brief update.</p>
<p>The bridge team at Element is still actively working on the issues that led to the bridge being disabled in the first place. You can see some of the work that‚Äôs in flight through GitHub PRs: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1757">#1757</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1766">#1766</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1764">#1764</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1734">#1734</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also looking into a way to transition responsibility for the bridge from Element to being directly run by The Matrix.org Foundation over the coming months - more details as we have them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not yet have a clear timeline for bringing the bridge back online. We‚Äôll continue providing regular updates and will share more information as soon as we can. Thank you again for your patience! Please do not hesitate to reach out at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>We've been quite busy at IETF 117 this last week discussing MLS and MIMI in several contexts, meetings, and sessions. Overall things have moved pretty fast in the last week, but the short summary is we're working with MIMI to get (Linearized) Matrix used as the new-found "signalling layer". This layer delegates membership of the room to the crypto layer when the crypto layer (namely MLS) supports being used as such, and is responsible for enforcing all policies. Policies in the context of MIMI are things like join rules, history visibility, and power levels, but with an added twist: we're looking at supporting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in combination with power levels in MIMI, which should also bring RBAC to Matrix in the form of a currently-unwritten MSC.</p>
<p>All told, we've got several new documents to write and MSCs to draft, but we'll get there in time. The MIMI working group is expecting solutions in place by about September, so watch this space for more news as we progress. An architecture draft is also in progress on the MIMI side to further explain what all of these new layers mean. In the meantime, if you have questions then please visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">the matrix-spec room</a> on Matrix!</p>
<p>We're also looking for more Matrix 1.9 candidates. Currently we have just custom emoji and anything to do with MIMI on the agenda - if you'd like to add more, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team room</a> on Matrix.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3062">MSC3062: Bot verification</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC describes a method for verifying (cross-signing) the devices of a bot user, and how verification of that sort could be done. Obviously it wouldn't make much sense to verify emoji with a bot. Instead, this MSC suggests that the bot provide a URL to present to the user. If the URL appears trustworthy (those who would control this URL should also be in charge of this bot), then the user can choose to continue the verification.</p>
<p>The user's Matrix client would then make a request to the URL with details of the verification. If the server responds successfully, some cryptographic magic happens, and your client will consider the bot verified!</p>
<p>This is essentially tying a bot's verification with control of a domain's DNS, which I think is a smart way to do things. But you do need to watch out for those pesky UTF-8 control characters when asking the user to verify the URL!</p>

                <p>We have recently announced that <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/deportalling-libera-chat/">we will be honouring Libera Chat‚Äôs request</a> to turn off portalled rooms on the Libera.Chat bridge maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The changes were originally scheduled to be effective on 31st July. In the meantime, we posted <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/make-sure-libera-bridge-keeps-working/">instructions for people to turn their portalled rooms into plumbed ones</a> so the bridge keeps working for them.</p>
<p>Some stability issues on the bridge have prevented people from turning their portalled rooms into plumbed ones. We have been actively working on resolving those issues since the first reports and the situation is gradually improving. However, at this point, we do not believe the plumbed mode can be considered sufficiently stable yet.</p>

<p>Work to use Matrix as the standard for interoperable messaging at the IETF is continuing in full stride. At <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/">IETF 117</a> (July 22nd - 28th, 2023) we'll be talking about the precise requirements of an interoperable protocol, and encouraging Matrix be that protocol. Linearized Matrix is our proposal for the room model, with more updates expected in the coming days ahead of the submission deadline, meanwhile yours truly is working on using MSC1767 Extensible Events for a content format. Watch this space for updates leading up to IETF 117 üôÇ</p>
<p>We're also well on track to test interoperability of different Linearized Matrix implementations at the Hackathon - get in touch with us via the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if you're working on such an implementation so we can coordinate details. It's not too late to get started either; Linearized Matrix itself is relatively simple to implement compared to the full capability of Matrix, by design.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3903">MSC3903: X25519 Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral for establishing secure channel between two Matrix clients</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC provides a means of establishing a trusted, secure communications channel across a potentially untrusted network. Subsequent MSCs could then use this channel to transfer details such as login tokens or key backup credentials in the context of setting up a new Matrix device. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906">MSC3906</a> is one proposal that takes advantage of this.</p>
<p>This is just one piece of work building on the tree of MSCs supporting the shift of authentication in Matrix from home-brewed to OIDC. See <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">https://areweoidcyet.com/</a> for more details on that effort.</p>

                <p>We launched the Matrix Public Archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULbvBIwiGEI">publicly on June 2nd, 2023</a>.
We decided to take it down on Sunday, June 25th out of precaution after a
member of OFTC staff warned us that the archive made the content of two OFTC IRC
channels bridged to Matrix available on the Internet.</p>
<p>After investigating the issue, we determined that the Matrix Public Archive's
behaviour was expected for these channels, given an IRC chanop had
<strong>explicitly</strong> configured the Matrix side of the rooms to be world-readable.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how room visibility works in vanilla Matrix, how it works with
bridges, and what are the next steps.</p>

                <p>We were already proud to <a href="/blog/2021/07/21/germany-s-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix/">announce</a>
that the national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system in
Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>) had selected Matrix as the open standard
on which to base all its interoperable instant messaging standard, back in 2021.</p>
<p>We are now delighted to let the world know that they are doubling down on
sovereignty and sustainability: gematik is the first organisation of the public
sector to join the Matrix.org Foundation as a Silver member.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-in-the-public-sector">Collaboration in the public sector</h2>
<p>Our friends at the <a href="https://fsfe.org">FSFE</a> have been calling for software used
in public services to be free software in their
<a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/openletter/">Public Money Public Code campaign</a>. As
advocates of open standards and an open source project ourselves, this is
something we can get behind.</p>
<p>Software development can be an impenetrable world for people who don‚Äôt work in
the field. It can sometimes be difficult for people outside of our industry to
understand the importance of bitrotting and refactoring. One very unfortunate
effect of this is that <strong>new features are easy to fund because they feel very
tangible, but the most critical housekeeping work is not as appealing</strong>.</p>
<p>Yet, without regular refactoring to clean things up, it gets increasingly costly
and difficult to add new features. <strong>Counterintuitively, spending money on ‚Äúthe
boring tasks‚Äù is the most efficient use of money</strong>: without it the technical
stack would become either obsolete, bloated, or both, and it would be much more
costly to move to something else or maintain an in-house fork.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre very happy gematik is doing the right thing by supporting the technical
stack it builds TI-Messenger on. By supporting the Matrix.org Foundation,
gematik contributes to the sustainability of the protocol powering the
communications of the German healthcare system‚Ä¶ but not exclusively.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-costs-across-public-services-and-with-the-private-sector">Sharing costs across public services, and with the private sector</h2>
<p>Matrix is an open standard, which means not only everyone can use it: when
someone contributes to Matrix, everyone benefits from it. This makes Matrix
particularly interesting for the public sector: if the German healthcare
contributes to Matrix, the <a href="https://element.io/case-studies/bundeswehr">German Armed Forces</a>
benefit from it, and the other way around. <strong>It allows both to contribute less
of their budget, instead of contributing each to an entirely different
product.</strong> The German Federal Ministry of Defence already actively contributes
to Matrix development and funding via its public IT services provider BWI GmbH,
who relies on Element‚Äôs consulting services to develop their own Matrix-based
messenger.</p>
<p>But Matrix being open source, it also allows the public and private sector to
share the costs of maintenance <em>by design</em>. <strong>The public sector benefits from
the contributions of the private sector to Matrix, and the opposite is true as
well.</strong></p>
<p>The Foundation plays a critical technical <em>and social</em> role in this system: it
centralises and curates contributions to the protocol so it remains unbiased,
coherent, and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-a-beginning">This is just a beginning</h2>
<p>We‚Äôre extremely happy to welcome the first public sector organisation in the
Matrix.org Foundation! Given how popular Matrix is among governments and the
public sector in general, we know this is just a beginning: it would be
illogical to deploy any solution at a large scale without contributing to its
sustainability.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre an organisation from the public or the private sector, looking to
cut costs down by building on a common, standard and reliable foundation, you
can <a href="https://matrix.org/support/">support Matrix</a> and
<a href="https://matrix.org/membership/">join the Foundation</a> today.</p>
