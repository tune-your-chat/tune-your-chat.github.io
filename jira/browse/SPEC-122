  Lots of people have said they'd love to run a matrix server, but it'd cost too much to maintain a VPS.

  It'd be fun to do the thought experiment to work out really what's needed to run a server clientside, e.g. on a phone.  Obvious things that come to mind are:

   * A dialect of the s-s API which lets a firewalled server always initiate connections (be it long-poll or websockets or TURN or whatever), whilst somehow handling new invites?
   * .well-known URIs or dyndns SRV or whatever for discovering where the server currently is (if folks are discovering it)
