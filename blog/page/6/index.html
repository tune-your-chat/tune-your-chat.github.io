<p>Today we launch a new fundraising drive, talk about the scope of the Foundation's work, and begin to unpack our emerging roadmap for the future. <strong>There is a lot going on and we need your help to keep it going!</strong></p>
<p>At the end of 2022 Matthew and Amandine <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2022/">sounded the alarm</a>: the Foundation needed more support. To deliver that, they <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/01/funding-matrix-via-the-matrix-org-foundation/#introducing-foundation-memberships-and-the-governing-board">launched the Foundation's membership program</a>. They also introduced open governance, and committed to hiring a Managing Director to act as a robust, neutral steward.</p>
<p><strong>You can help: If you are already sold on Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.org/membership/">become a member today</a>.</strong> To find out how the last year has gone, and how your support helps us to serve the Matrix ecosystem, read on.</p>
<p>Over the last year, there are lots of positive, healthy signs for Matrix. New members like <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/beeper-joins-the-foundation/">Beeper</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/gematik-joins-the-foundation/">gematik</a> ‚Äî and hundreds of individuals ‚Äã‚Äî boosted our annual revenues from ¬£82K to ¬£364K. The open network has grown from 80.3M to 115M addressable users. We've invested in long-term interoperability efforts at the IETF. And we've shifted focus from experiments to polish, usability, and advocacy.</p>
<p>We've supported development of core libraries, and subsidize hosting for FOSS communities like GNOME and KDE. The Foundation runs the Matrix.org homeserver, with over 250K daily active users, and operates several public bots and bridges. And indeed, the Foundation <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/10/26/hello-world/">hired a Managing Director</a> üëã.</p>
<p>You'll find a full accounting of our 2023 activity and finances in our first Annual Report, slated to come out around April 2024.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals">https://spec.matrix.org/proposals</a>.</p>

<p>For those familiar with Travis' weekly task lists of MSCs for the Spec Core Team to review in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team room</a>, a new weekly list is now being posted in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!KzgjYxOASBbBMrtCXC:matrix.org/$QqpbS4hdFuxy6vPIz80eeGjnGXwJWJInMJFlNqG7y98?via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io&amp;via=envs.net">Matrix Spec &amp; Docs Authoring room</a>. This list is aimed at technical writers who can help by converting MSC authors' words into PRs against the spec text itself.</p>
<p>This is the final step for getting an MSC integrated into a new release of the Matrix spec, and anyone can try their hand at it! It would also very much help the Spec Core Team by freeing up more bandwidth for review of the MSC backlog, as well as push forward the protocol itself. Thank you!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the relevant Matrix rooms.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4003">MSC4003: Semantic table attributes</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes expanding the set of suggested, interpreted HTML tags in Matrix clients to include additional tags related to tables. With them, more control over table rendering is possible. The proposal itself includes one such (albeit fairly arbitrary) example</p>
<p>The proposal is well-written and straight-forward, so do feel free to have a look if the subject interests you!</p>

            <p>We join our voices to technology companies, trade associations and other supporters in asking EU member states to align the Council's position on the CSA Regulation to the position agreed by the Parliament.</p>
<p>Safeguarding encryption should be a priority in negotiations, ensuring the protection of rights and freedoms around privacy and security of communications.</p>
<p>A copy of the open letter sent to ministers can be read below.</p>
<h2 id="open-letter-to-eu-member-states-on-the-proposed-csa-regulation">Open letter to EU Member States on the proposed CSA Regulation</h2>
<p>Dear Ministers of the Interior, Justice, and Economy of EU Member States,</p>
<p>We write to you as small and medium-sized companies and organizations from Europe, concerned about the proposal for a Regulation on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). Collectively, we call on you to ensure that your country‚Äôs position on this file is brought as close as possible to the European Parliament‚Äôs (EP) one.
We all agree that ensuring children are safe online is one of the most important duties of tech companies and for this reason, we find the European Commission‚Äôs proposed Regulation extremely worrying. If it were implemented as proposed, it would negatively impact children‚Äôs privacy and security online, while also having dramatic unforeseen consequences on the EU cybersecurity landscape, on top of creating an ineffective administrative burden<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
The European Parliament recently adopted its position on the file, acknowledging that scanning technologies are not compatible with the aim of having confidential and secure communications.  The crucial changes it therefore puts forward for the proposal reflect the opinions of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), the Council legal services as well as countless experts in cryptography and cybersecurity<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. It also reflects the opinion of between 63% and 69% of the companies, public authorities, NGOs and citizens consulted by the European Commission in its Impact Assessment<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.
As small and medium-sized tech companies and organizations, we share their concerns as we know that looking for specific content ‚Äì such as text, photos and videos ‚Äì in an end-to-end encrypted communication would require the implementation of a backdoor, or of a similar technology called ‚Äúclient-side scanning‚Äù. Even if this mechanism is created with the purpose of fighting crime online, it would also quickly be used by criminals themselves, putting citizens and businesses more at risk online by creating vulnerabilities for all users alike.</p>
<h3 id="data-protection-is-a-strong-competitive-advantage">Data protection is a strong competitive advantage</h3>
<p>As tech companies operating within the European Union, we have built products and services in line with the strong data protection framework of the EU which still serves as an example and inspiration across the world.</p>
<p>The GDPR allowed for the creation of ethical, privacy-first tech companies in Europe, that would otherwise never have been able to compete against Big Tech. It gave European companies a strong competitive advantage in that field internationally and allowed consumers to finally be able to find alternatives to American and Chinese services. Our users, both within the EU and beyond, have come to trust our commitment to safeguarding their data and this trust is a key driver of our competitiveness. The learning curve for adapting to the necessary administrative burden brought about by the GDPR was high but was worth it.
However, the CSA Regulation could threaten this unique selling point of European IT companies and would also add a new administrative burden which we fear could overwhelm both our companies and law enforcement bodies. Considering the volume of communications and content transiting through our services, even an insignificant error rate of the technologies applied to scan for abusive material would result in millions of false positives to be manually reviewed every day.</p>
<h3 id="the-csa-regulation-could-erode-trust-and-safety-online">The CSA Regulation could erode trust and safety online</h3>
<p>In a world where data breaches and privacy scandals are increasingly common, the EU's reputation for stringent data protection is a unique selling point for businesses operating within its borders. It provides us with a competitive edge, assuring our customers that their information is handled with the utmost care and integrity. This trust, once eroded, is challenging to rebuild, and any measures that compromise it such as mandatory scanning, or mandatory age verification have the potential to harm businesses both large and small.
Furthermore, the EU has recently adopted Regulation 2023/2841, which mandates that EU Institutions and bodies to consider the use of end-to-end encryption among their cybersecurity risk-management measures. There are also multiple ‚Äòcyber‚Äô EU proposals currently on the table, such as the Cyber Resilience Act and the Cybersecurity Act. Supporting an opposite approach for the CSA Regulation would only undermine the EU cybersecurity framework creating a contradictory, incoherent and inefficient new set of measures that companies would not be able to enforce without putting citizens and businesses at risk.</p>
<h3 id="the-eu-parliament-s-proposal-goes-in-the-right-direction">The EU Parliament's proposal goes in the right direction</h3>
<p>Therefore, we applaud the European Parliament for its resolute stance in defending the European citizens' right to privacy and secure communication. The European Parliament‚Äôs commitment to these principles is not only a testament to its dedication to human rights, but also a beacon of hope for businesses like ours that prioritize data protection and security. The position of the Parliament includes alternatives to scanning which have a minimal impact on cybersecurity and data protection, and which experts believe would be both more effective and more efficient than mandatory scanning. Such changes of paradigm would mean going beyond the false dichotomy between privacy and security, while also making the proposal respect the proportionality principle, as requested by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board.
Even if not perfect in our eyes, the changes the European Parliament made in its position are a good compromise to maintain digital security and confidentiality and to better protect children online. We believe that these changes strike the right balance between child protection and safeguarding privacy and cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>As representatives of the vibrant European small businesses community, we encourage EU Member States to continue championing the values of privacy, cybersecurity and data protection. These principles not only align with the EU's commitment to human rights, but also serve as a foundation for a thriving and competitive business environment. Let us defend and strengthen these principles, ensuring that the EU remains an advocate of privacy in the global marketplace.</strong></p>
<p>For these reasons we call on you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that Council‚Äôs position is aligned as closely as possible to the European Parliament‚Äôs. This will allow for a swifter adoption of the Regulation while building on the important work of the European Parliament.</li>
<li>Maintain the high level of fundamental rights - and in particular data protection ‚Äì enjoyed by citizens in the European Union.</li>
<li>Refrain from forcing companies like us to conduct mass surveillance of private correspondence on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</li>
<li>Guarantee a high level of cybersecurity in the EU by protecting end-to-end encryption and bringing the necessary safeguards in the text. Client-side scanning and backdoors in particular should not be mandated.</li>
<li>Preserve the confidentiality of correspondence.</li>
<li>Minimize the administrative burden of the proposal by making it more effective and efficient, through alternatives to mass scanning.</li>

<p>For those familiar with Travis' weekly task lists of MSCs for the Spec Core Team to review in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team room</a>, a new weekly list is now being posted in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!KzgjYxOASBbBMrtCXC:matrix.org/$QqpbS4hdFuxy6vPIz80eeGjnGXwJWJInMJFlNqG7y98?via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io&amp;via=envs.net">Matrix Spec &amp; Docs Authoring room</a>. This list is aimed at technical writers who can help by converting MSC authors' words into PRs against the spec text itself.</p>
<p>This is the final step for getting an MSC integrated into a new release of the Matrix spec, and anyone can try their hand at it! It would also very much help the Spec Core Team by freeing up more bandwidth for review of the MSC backlog, as well as push forward the protocol itself. Thank you!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the relevant Matrix rooms.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4003">MSC4003: Semantic table attributes</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes expanding the set of suggested, interpreted HTML tags in Matrix clients to include additional tags related to tables. With them, more control over table rendering is possible. The proposal itself includes one such (albeit fairly arbitrary) example</p>
<p>The proposal is well-written and straight-forward, so do feel free to have a look if the subject interests you!</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>2023 has been a pivotal year for Matrix, with huge changes landing both organisationally and technically to prepare the protocol for future generations.  The ecosystem has once again gone from strength to strength, with active users (based on Synapse opt-in phone-home reporting) doubling across the public network, and more projects building on Matrix than we can count (look out for the ‚ÄúThis Year in Matrix‚Äù community wrap-up blog post) - and more organisations than we can track joining Matrix for all their secure decentralised communication needs.</p>
<p>On the governance side, we are in an incredibly exciting new era with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/10/26/hello-world/">Josh joining the Matrix.org Foundation</a> as its first ever Managing Director (and employee!), with a mandate to cement sustainable funding for Matrix as an independent foundation, governed by the forthcoming elected <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/12/electing-our-first-governing-board/">open Governance Board</a>.  Now, <strong>Matrix needs funding more than ever</strong> - but rather than turning the entirety of this post into a plea for donations, I‚Äôm going to let Josh fly the flag in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, if you want Matrix to keep existing (especially if you‚Äôre an organisation who builds on Matrix) <strong><a href="https://matrix.org/membership/">please join the Foundation</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/support">donate</a>.</strong></p>
<p>On the technical side: the theme of the year has been one of focus: extreme, overdue, focus.</p>
<p>Over the years, it‚Äôs fair to say that the core team has tried to strike a balance between building the core foundational technology of Matrix (the spec, a stable server implementation, client SDKs, end-to-end encryption, VoIP, etc)... and long-term forward-looking projects designed to futureproof Matrix (e.g. Account Portability, P2P Matrix, Dendrite, Hydrogen) and/or inspire developers to build on Matrix for more than just chat (e.g. Third Room, Applications Beyond Chat).  In retrospect, this was wildly optimistic: we underestimated the amount of remaining work needed to polish the foundational tech to mainstream quality - and despite Matrix uptake going through the roof, this hasn‚Äôt translated into sufficient funding to have the luxury to support folks to proactively work on next-gen projects (or foundational projects, for that matter).</p>
<p>So, this year, we‚Äôve ended up focused on one thing: getting the foundational Matrix featureset to better-than-mainstream quality, performance and stability.  We‚Äôve dubbed the overall initiative Matrix 2.0, and kicked it off at <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/">FOSDEM 2023</a> with our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matrix 2.0: How we‚Äôre making Matrix go vooooom</a> main-stage talk.</p>
<h3 id="the-road-to-matrix-2-0">The Road to Matrix 2.0</h3>
<p>Matrix 2.0 isn‚Äôt (yet) an actual versioned release of the Matrix specification - instead, it describes the various foundational projects needed to get quality, performance and stability up to and beyond that of today‚Äôs mainstream messaging apps.  These projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>)</strong>: the ability to instantly log in, launch and sync Matrix clients no matter how large or busy the account.</li>
<li><strong>Native E2EE Group VoIP (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3898">MSC3898</a> + TBA)</strong>: scalable video and voice conferencing and calling built natively on Matrix and so benefiting from Matrix‚Äôs end-to-end encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Native OIDC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">MSC3861</a>)</strong>: replacing Matrix‚Äôs historical authentication mechanisms with industry-standard Open ID Connect (giving us two factor authentication, multi-factor auth, passkeys, and radically simplifying auth implementations for both client and server developers).</li>
<li><strong>Faster Remote Room Joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">MSC3902</a></strong>): letting servers rapidly join rooms on other servers by incrementally participating in the room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of the year Matrix 2.0 has gone from the initial demo on stage at FOSDEM to concrete implementations which users can play with today as announced in our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/matrix-2-0/">Matrix 2.0: The Future of Matrix</a> post in September.  Since then, we‚Äôve been busy polishing away.  On Sliding Sync, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sliding-sync">proxy</a> has pretty much stabilised - although the protocol itself can and should be simplified before we think seriously about native implementations (in practice, having the server track room list ordering gets very fiddly when only clients can really determine the final ordering, due to E2EE).  <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-x-ignition/">Element X</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> has been the main implementation driving forwards Sliding Sync and much of the other Matrix 2.0 work, for those itching to play with it.</p>
<p>On Native Group VoIP: we‚Äôve gone through many iterations over the year - starting off with Full Mesh calling (good for ~7 users per call); then switching to the experimental <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/waterfall">waterfall</a> Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) to provide scalable but not-E2EE conferencing; and then switching to a hybrid solution using LiveKit to provide an E2EE-capable scalable SFU, but with the signalling and encryption all handled by Matrix.  Element Call is the main implementation driving forwards the underlying Matrix work here, and <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-3/">Element Call Beta 3</a> showed off the new LiveKit based implementation in July - which was then <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-x-now-with-embedded-voip/">integrated with Element X</a> complete with end-to-end encryption in November.  There‚Äôs still some polishing remaining here, with a new layout engine in the wings for Element Call, and enabling full encrypted-per-sender conferencing by default in both Element Web and Element X, but it really feels like the hardest work is behind us now: the core team has been successfully doing all of its collaboration on <a href="https://call.element.io">Element Call</a> for months now, like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/20230921-element-call.png" alt="E2EE scalable Element Call" /></p>
<p>On Open ID Connect: things are also shaping up well. This will be the first time that we‚Äôve replaced a large chunk of the Matrix spec with something else, and in order to manage your account in Matrix 2.0-native clients like Element X homeserver admins will need to migrate their authentication to the new OIDC World using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service">matrix-authentication-service</a> (MAS).  There‚Äôs a great <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/better-auth/">blog post</a> from September which explains what this will entail - and since then, we even have the beginnings of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service/tree/main/tools/syn2mas">syn2mas</a>: a migration script to migrate from Synapse-managed accounts to MAS-managed accounts (warning: still experimental).  The Matrix.org homeserver hasn‚Äôt been migrated yet (as we need to support social login first), but an increasing number of standalone Matrix servers are going OIDC-native, so arguably the migration has already begun!  We‚Äôll keep <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com">https://areweoidcyet.com</a> updated as the project progresses.</p>
<p>Finally, the core of Faster Remote Room Joins (FRRJ) shipped in Synapse back in February. There‚Äôs still some major speedups that FRRJ could unlock, but the other tracks of Matrix 2.0 have been taking priority.</p>
<p>So: Matrix 2.0 is palpably on the horizon - all that remains is polish on the example clients (Element X &amp; Element Call), full support for migrating to OIDC, and landing the MSCs into the spec. For instance, Element X just added read receipts and (early) E2EE backup support in the last few days - the gap is closing! It‚Äôs worth noting that significant amounts of this work has been funded by BWI for <a href="https://messenger.bwi.de/">BwMessenger</a> and <a href="https://messenger.bwi.de/bundesmessenger">BundesMessenger</a>: huge thanks to BWI for supporting core Matrix development by contracting Element.</p>
<h3 id="levelling-up-on-encryption">Levelling up on Encryption</h3>
<p>Encryption stability received a huge amount of attention this year. It turns out that reliable end-to-end encryption is surprisingly tricky in a decentralised environment, and historically we‚Äôve been playing on hard mode by implementing three entirely separate implementations of the Matrix layer of encryption between matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2, each with their own bugs - more than tripling the costs of development, audits, and maintenance by the Foundation (quite ignoring the independent implementations from the community in mtxclient, libquotient, matrix-dart-sdk, trixnity etc).</p>
<p>So a huge project has been underway to converge on a single auditable codebase for the core team‚Äôs E2EE implementation so that any bugs or future features can be resolved in a single place. That codebase is matrix-rust-sdk‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto">matrix-sdk-crypto</a> crate (and our underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">vodozemac</a> double ratchet implementation) - and we‚Äôre proud to say that we are using it for encryption in matrix-rust-sdk itself (as showcased by Element X and Fractal 5), matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 (as used in the old Element iOS &amp; Android apps), and have now merged it in matrix-js-sdk too (available for new logins on <a href="https://tune-your-chat.github.io/blog/2023/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2023/develop.element.io">develop.element.io</a>).  The process of rustifying the encryption in Element Web and the old iOS &amp; Android apps has been nicknamed ‚ÄúElement R‚Äù.</p>
<p>The process of switching matrix-js-sdk to use Rust encryption has been particularly gruelling, requiring compiling matrix-sdk-crypto down to WASM as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm">matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm</a> and then doing heart surgery to replace the old JS crypto implementation‚Ä¶ while also needing to extensively loop from WASM back into the browser to use IndexedDB for storage, all while outperforming the old implementation.  It‚Äôs tantalisingly close now: while <a href="https://tune-your-chat.github.io/blog/2023/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2023/develop.element.io">develop.element.io</a> has it turned on by default for new logins, there are still a few remaining performance edge cases to be chased down related to online backup before we migrate everyone to it. The remaining <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AZ-Element-R-Blocker">blocking issues</a> can be found on GitHub for those interested in tracking progress.</p>
<p>matrix-crypto-sdk is already manifestly more reliable than the old implementations (in terms of the chances of hitting infamous Unable To Decrypt errors) - and now that we are so close to converging on it everywhere, the race is on to ensure that any remaining defects get flushed out for once and for all.  One of the new initiatives here is called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement-crypto">complement-crypto</a> - a full end-to-end torture testing suite specifically for matrix-crypto-sdk.  You can read all about it in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/12/01/this-week-in-matrix-2023-12-01/#complement-website">the announcement post</a> a few weeks ago, but suffice it to say it‚Äôs a super exciting project which stress-tests both matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk (with the new rust crypto implementation) against federated Synapse containers in order to test E2EE under the most horrible failure modes imaginable.  It‚Äôs already picked up some elusive bugs which have plagued us for literally years, and it looks set to be the main framework by which we will hunt down and kill any remaining issues.  See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement-crypto/?tab=readme-ov-file#test-hitlist">Test hitlist</a> for the full scope we‚Äôre targeting.</p>
<p>Now that everyone‚Äôs (almost) converged on matrix-sdk-crypto, the next big project for the Crypto Team is going to be improving the E2EE usability (at last!).  The big news here is that we‚Äôre shifting to Trust On First Use (TOFU) for user trust.  Specifically: this means that we will only encrypt messages to devices whose owner has explicitly cross-signed them (essentially trusting the owner by default).  You will still be able to explicitly verify that other users are not being impersonated (via QR scan or emoji comparison), but this should improve the default behaviour to be much more secure.  Alongside TOFU will come other radical simplifications of the E2EE UX (both around login, self-verification, cross-verification and backup), so watch this space: the game is afoot to finally fix Matrix‚Äôs E2EE usability, now we can make all the changes in one place!</p>
<p>Finally, work continues to progress at <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/matrix-dmls">matrix-dmls</a> on supporting a decentralised dialect of Messaging Layer Security (MLS, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/">RFC9420</a>) on top of Matrix as an alternative to our normal Olm/Megolm encryption, with recent work focused on making it play nice with matrix-sdk-crypto. <a href="https://arewemlsyet.com">https://arewemlsyet.com</a> is the place to track updates (although it‚Äôs a bit overdue for an update).</p>
<h3 id="in-other-news">In other news</h3>
<p>Faced with limited funding and the decision to focus exclusively on stability, reliability and performance, there have inevitably been some major changes impacting the core team.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes is that Element (the company formed by the core Matrix team back in 2017 to try to fund our work on Matrix) can no longer financially afford to donate its work on Synapse and other server components to the Matrix Foundation under the permissive Apache licence. Instead, Element is continuing development under the copyleft AGPLv3 licence at <a href="https://tune-your-chat.github.io/blog/2023/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2023/github.com/element-hq/synapse">github.com/element-hq/synapse</a> going forwards. This is to let Element sell AGPL exceptions to commercial Matrix vendors in order to fund their underlying Matrix development: you can read more about it at <a href="https://element.io/blog/synapse-now-lives-at-github-com-element-hq-synapse/">Element‚Äôs announcement</a> - or you can listen to this week‚Äôs Matrix Live for a firsthand explanation:</p>
<p><noscript>Matrix Live S09E13: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejpjTZhL8MA">https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejpjTZhL8MA</a></noscript>
<youtube-player video-id="ejpjTZhL8MA"></youtube-player></p>
<p>The other major change is that we‚Äôve had no choice but pause development on the majority of the core team‚Äôs next-generation Matrix projects.  We had high hopes of being able to secure dedicated funding for <a href="https://tune-your-chat.github.io/blog/2023/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2023/thirdroom.io">Third Room</a> (especially after the awesome <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/07/introducing-third-room-tp-2-the-creator-update/">Tech Preview 2: Creator Update</a> in June), but the interested parties did not come through, and the team has now disbanded.  Meanwhile, P2P Matrix and Low Bandwidth Matrix is on hiatus until there‚Äôs dedicated funding - and Account Portability work is also temporarily paused in favour of commercial Element work, despite the fantastic progress made recently with Pseudo IDs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4014">MSC4014</a>) and Cryptographic identifiers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4080">MSC4080</a>).  Given P2P Matrix and Account Portability were the main projects driving Dendrite development recently, this may also cause a slow-down in Dendrite development, although Dendrite itself will still be maintained.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is far from an ideal situation: we sent up distress flares loud and clear at the beginning of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2022/">last year‚Äôs holiday update</a>; and we‚Äôve now had to shrink to focus exclusively on the core projects.  However, we‚Äôre optimistic that the tighter focus in the medium term will help us get back to the point where we can resume the longer-term projects - assuming that organisations (and individuals) dependent on Matrix <a href="https://matrix.org/support">sign up to support the project.</a></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Despite the downsides of 2023, right now we‚Äôre feeling distinctly optimistic: Matrix 2.0 clients like Element X already outperform the best proprietary mainstream options by many metrics - and focusing purely on improving the foundations is only going to improve that. We may not have taken the most direct route to get to where we are today, but it genuinely feels like 2024 will be the year where Matrix overtakes the incumbents.</p>
<p>Talking of which, there‚Äôs just one last thing to mention: amidst the economic challenges of 2023, one future-facing core team Matrix project has survived: our work around the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA).  The DMA is leading antitrust legislation from the European Commission, which aims to stop big centralised tech companies (so called ‚Äògatekeepers‚Äô) from carelessly suppressing innovation, competition and consumer choice by trapping users inside their walled gardens.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we‚Äôve been tracking the DMA closely throughout its gestation, and we‚Äôre now in the final sprint: in March 2024, messaging services which have been identified as gatekeepers will have to open their networks to allow interoperability with requesting messaging services (while preserving E2EE, if they‚Äôre encrypted).  So far, only WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have been identified as gatekeeper services (Apple is doing everything they can to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/06/apple-may-yet-prevail-in-eu-imessage-antitrust-investigation">wriggle out of it</a>).  However, it looks like WhatsApp is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/10/23866912/whatsapp-cross-platform-messaging-eu-dma-meta">taking it seriously</a>, which could prove very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>As Matrix, we‚Äôve taken a two-pronged approach: on one side, showcasing how Matrix as it stands today can already bridge existing chat systems together as a highest-common-denominator protocol (including preserving E2EE, if they happen to already use the Double Ratchet).  On the other side, we‚Äôve also been contributing significantly to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/mimi/about/">MIMI</a>, the IETF Working Group dedicated to standardising a lowest-common-denominator protocol specifically for DMA interoperability.</p>
<p>2023 has involved a lot of work on MIMI, participating in the Design Team alongside Phoenix, Wire, Cisco, Google and Wickr - and at IETF 118 in Prague in November we collectively proposed the first <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ralston-mimi-protocol-01">draft of the protocol</a> (see also the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/118/materials/slides-118-mimi-mimi-architecture-00">architecture presentation</a> for context). MIMI has ended up taking some inspiration from Matrix (and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix/">Linearized Matrix</a>, a simplified dialect we proposed which does away with full-mesh decentralisation), while focusing very tightly on the specific problems of server-to-server interop between existing communication services - leaning on MLS (where available) for synchronising state across the services, while also leaving the door open for using the Double Ratchet to provide an on-ramp for pragmatic bridging to today‚Äôs services (including Matrix!).</p>
<p>MIMI‚Äôs tight focus means that it doesn‚Äôt currently provide conversation history, arbitrary state events, or decentralised conversations - and is focused purely on server-server communication.  However, there‚Äôs certainly a world where Matrix could evolve to be compatible with MIMI - such a hypothetical Matrix 3.0 would effectively layer Matrix‚Äôs richer existing semantics (decentralised conversations, extensible state events, state resolution, group VoIP etc) on top of MIMI‚Äôs subset of functionality.  It‚Äôll be interesting to see how this plays out.  Meanwhile, we‚Äôll continue to provide both Matrix for pragmatic DMA interoperability for today - and participate in MIMI for IETF-track interoperability.</p>
<p>Anyhow: hopefully it‚Äôs clear that 2024 is going to be a super interesting year for Matrix - whether that‚Äôs simply by nailing Matrix 2.0, or whatever excitements DMA interoperability brings. And if you‚Äôre relying on Matrix: <strong><a href="https://matrix.org/support">please donate</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile - have a fantastic end of the year; and thanks once again for flying Matrix.</p>
<p>- Matthew, Amandine, Josh &amp; the whole team.</p>
