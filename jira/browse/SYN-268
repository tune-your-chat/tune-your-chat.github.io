summary: Add ability for server to drop privileges

  I currently store SSL keys in /etc/ssl/private, which my OS makes 0700. However, I'd like for most of Synapse to run as an unprivileged user for obvious security reasons.

  Could Synapse have --user and --group flags that make it run as a different user when launched as root, after configuration/initialization is complete? At least I'd like it if SSL certificates/keys were read as root so I don't have to copy keys or loosen perms on /etc/ssl/private.

  Thanks!

    This should be fairly easy to implement, since I believe we already have read the necessary files by the time we daemonize. The places that would need to be changed are:
    - Adding config option to: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/synapse/config/server.py
    - Pass the user/group config to Daemonize: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/synapse/app/homeserver.py#L282
