  gonz I don't get notifications with sound from the android app. Is there any reason this should be the case? gonz In the settings I have it set up so that it should notify with sound for mentions of my user-id/displayname. gonz Yet, it doesn't even activate the screen when I receive a notification, for example. It'll activate the LED, but no there's no real alert and you have to be paying attention to the phone to really notice it. I made a remind-command that will send reminders on a requested time, but it kind of depends on being reminded properly, which isn't the case right now. matthew: I downloaded the app from the Google Play store or whatever. gonz Tried 261, still getting silent notifications

  body: "Did you add some extra rules which could disable sound ?\t\n\n for example, you added a rule to be notified for any new messages in a room but without sound (the per room notifications).\n\n so, you will never get sound for this room messages even if there is a rule with your name: Your own rules has priority above the predefined rules."
