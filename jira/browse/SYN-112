  At TC Disrupt London hackathon we saw several people entirely fail to run synapse because they couldn't install the deps on a virginal OSX 10.9 machine.

  The problem that setuptools pulls in the wrong pynacl, that you then have to manually remove and pip install (complete with confusions over ~/.local versus system installs etc) is a huge mess.

  Are we not better off depending on our own package until the fix lands?

    I've added a dependency link for pynacl on github pointing at the current master where they seem to have fixed some of the installation problems https://github.com/pyca/pynacl/commit/52dbe2dc33f1a062317a098ca9afb77aadd13ab1

    Hopefully that should make it easier for people to install pynacl.
