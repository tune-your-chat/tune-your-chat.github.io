description: |-
  The application tag in the sdk manifest adds attributes that collide with applications that it's included in, e.g.

  Error:(9, 9) Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugManifest'.
  > Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@icon value=(@mipmap/ic_launcher) from AndroidManifest.xml:9:9
      is also present at test:matrix-sdk:unspecified:15:9 value=(@drawable/ic_launcher)
      Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:icon"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:7:5 to override

  Afaik the application tag doesn't really serve any purpose and could be removed
