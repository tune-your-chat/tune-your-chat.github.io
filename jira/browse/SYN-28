  The current common use case for Synapse is that people install it running as localhost - have a play with it; see that it's good.

  They then want to expose the same server to run as --server-name foo.net - except there isn't (as far as I know) an easy way to change the server-name without vaping the whole HS DB.  We need one.

    I don't think this can be done once the home server has federated with anyone else, since the remote will will always send to the old server name.

    For the special case of renaming from a localhost we can probably write a script that goes and rewrites the local DB.

    We need to think this through better before it's too late.

    If I decide to rebrand from foo.com to bar.com, it sounds like my only choice is to create a new HS DB containing the same account/profile names as before, and then somehow bootstrap these new users into the same rooms as the old ones (by inviting them using the old users)?

    This feels very unwieldy.  I guess supporting forwarding addresses would be a step in the better direction, and then we can migrate like email.  For now, however, I can't see anything better than a script which creates the new DB and helps guide you through rejoining your users into rooms as the new user (and possibly leaving those rooms as the old user).

    (Thank goodness we don't have 1:1 rooms!)
