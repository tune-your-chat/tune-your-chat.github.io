<p>Matrix v1.7 has been given a release date of <strong>May 25th</strong>, right before the next TWIM! Expect a matrix.org blog post with all the details on the day.</p>
<p>Leading up to the release we've seen a number of great spec PRs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">appearing and being merged</a>! Thank you to everyone for writing them (saving the SCT some time!) and to other reviewing on commenting. It's a huge help and the spec feels like it's chugging along at a blistering pace!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2213">MSC2213: Rejoinability of private/invite-only rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC adds the ability for users who have previously joined a room to rejoin again. Typically this isn't desired in a public room setting, but it does specifically make sense in the case of a DM that you've left and want to return to without the other user needing to invite you. This case has specific implications for cases where there could be only ever one room between two users. Being able to rejoin it if the other user has disappeared is key!</p>
<p>Outside of the DM use case, this functionality can mostly already be achieved by using <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted rooms</a>, where users of a given space/another room can always join your room. However, it would be nice to have the flexibility of allowing certain users to rejoin a room without needing another room to serve as proof of membership.</p>
<p>Is this something you're interested in? Do you have additional use cases? Feel free to check out the MSC and comment with your thoughts!</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>The Spec Core Team had another retro this week, and part of what we talked about was how most of the spec PR writing falls to just a few people. Starting this week, we're going to try and diversify that work across the Spec Core Team, both for reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> and increasing bandwidth of spec PRs. Hopefully the results of that will be noticeable!</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, "SAS verification" refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Synapse team is hard at work making Synapse faster and leaner. Work continues
apace on faster room joins over federation, and it seems that the work might land
sooner rather than later, although there are no solid dates yet.
In other news, profiling work is being done to determine ways to hopefully increase
the speed of local room joins and DM creation. Stay tuned for more information in the future on that.
Finally, it was an RC release week. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0rc2">Synapse 1.65.0rc2</a> was released, and it contains some fun features and bugfixes. Check it out!</p>

<p>Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>"join"</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>
<li>Stale cache data for membership lazy-loading is now correctly invalidated when doing a complete sync</li>
<li>Data races within user-interactive authentication have been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/tak-hntlabs">tak-hntlabs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our current test compliance figures to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 90%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite-related discussion.</p>

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! 👋
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. 🐳
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>That’s not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record 🎤</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we’re also looking at how to improve a user’s first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we’ve designed and built a checklist for new users. This checklist will help them to get off the ground and messaging friends in no time.</li>

<li>Threads improvements are still very much underway. We have a proof of concept (PoC) for improving notifications that we’re testing to ensure scalability and performance.</li>

<li>Our release this week was rejected by Apple. Their feedback? Our info.plist comments do not provide enough context as to why we’re asking for access to things like the camera, photos, or contacts. Never fear! We’ve updated our copy and we’re confident that it’s clearer than ever.</li>
<li>Also in the upcoming release:
<ul>
<li>Fixing the crashes that some users were running into when switching space.</li>
<li>The new in-app notifications now also appear in the notification centre</li>
<li>And a bug fix for the rare issue of sending duplicate images to a timeline when sending multiple photos</li>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>On July 28 project marked its one-year milestone. During this time it has grown at an unexpected rate, both in terms of development as well as popularity. This is great news, so let's celebrate that with this birthday edition.</p>
<p>In this update, we have added <strong>Custom emoji and sticker support</strong> to Cinny. Custom emoji and stickers were not in our roadmap but that's the surprise. Aren't they cool?
Apart from the emoji and stickers, there are tons of other features such as Blurhash, Mark entire space as read, user pills, and bug fixes. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.0">release</a> <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.1">page</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.2">detailed changelog</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the roadmap, we are still on that, work on the "Rich input editor" is in progress and will come as the next release. Stay tuned for that!</p>
<p>The update is live on <a href="https://app.cinny.in/">https://app.cinny.in</a> and the desktop app can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.2">Github</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>

<p>This bridge connects users on Matrix and Discord – or other platforms, if combined with other bridges.
Earlier this year the community bridge has been adopted by the Matrix.org bridge team to give it some attention.
Its most recent update dated back to December 2020 and some fixes waited for a new release.</p>
<p>Well, here it is! v2.0.0
Its breaking changes are the requirement of NodeJS 14 or newer and the usage of <code>yarn</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.
Furthermore, the update introduces a changelog and rolls out the guidelines we use for developing other matrix.org bridges.</p>

<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ✨ for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! 📹️</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you’ll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem 🌌</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>

<p>I was able to to host a matrix-synapse server on termux app on an android device. I documented the process on <a href="https://github.com/medanisjbara/synapse-termux/">termux-synapse</a> github repo And started working on a script that automates the process (final commit is being currently tested before pushing).
It was a "for fun" type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.

<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>

<p>Definitely one of the most sought-after Matrix bridges lately.
Props to Half-Shot, Libera.Chat and everyone else for getting
it all together in such short notice.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="plumbing-irc-channels-adult-wrench">Plumbing IRC channels 🧑‍🔧</h4>
<p>Somewhat experimental feature that has landed this week is the ability to use single puppeting in a public Matrix room to bridge IRC channels.</p>
<p>This support comes through a new <code>PLUMB</code> admin command for network rooms that will ask the bridge bot to join a public Matrix room and an IRC channel.</p>
<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-lock">SASL support 🔒</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>
<h4 id="but-that-s-not-all">But that's not all</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identd will now always provide a unique ident for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved detection for stalled connections</p>

<li>
<p>IRC user ghosting issues fixed for good 🤞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server TLS cert checking fixes, self-signed support</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get "Decrypting message..." or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated 😀</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require "viewing" the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>

Kévin did an <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/759">internal restructuring of how we handle the SyncResponse in !759</a>. The visible consequence for users is that room categories (also known as tags) are updated directly in Fractal when the user changes it from an other client.

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Android 1.1.8 has been released on the beta track of the Google PlayStore. It will probably be pushed to production at the beginning of next week. The Android matrix SDK2 has also been released.</li>
<li>This week, we implemented the ability to change the network when looking in the room directory. Also gitter.im has been added to the default network list. See some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419</a></li>

years.</p>

<p>Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>

<p>We now report the password change capability properly (thanks <a href="https://github.com/bn4t">bn4t</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>

<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

<p>I made a Signal bridge using <a href="https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald">signald</a>.</p>
<p>Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week released <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/tag/v1.7.8">v1.7.8</a></p>
<p>Highlights include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure Backup has been moved out of the registration flow to a toast when you first encounter an E2EE room, which simplifies the new user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added options to hide various UI features when hosting a custom Element</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve on widget support for resizable widgets, modal widgets and generally making widgets better.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to work on instrumenting the app, improving mobile support for matrix.to and making jitsi calling more reliable.</p>

<h3 id="element-android">Element Android</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org">benoit</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Element Android: Version 1.0.8 is now available on the stores, it fixes issues with verification and PIN code among other issues (see <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8</a> for more details). Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received PRs for all of the remaining federation endpoints, and all but one have already been merged!</p>
<p>Now that the end is in sight, we're turning our focus elsewhere. We're working on cleaning up and fixing a few bugs in our event signing code and soon will create tracking issues for filling out the Identity Service API.</p>

<h3 id="t2bot-io">t2bot.io</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t2bot.io has crossed 1M monthly active users</p>
<p>All of these users are Telegram/Discord users that have been brought into Matrix over the last 30 days. This doesn't appear to be a temporary spike either: over the last 8 weeks t2bot.io has been hovering at 900-950 thousand monthly active users, up from 600-700 thousand. Record-setting traffic levels have also been achieved, with matrix.org being able to keep up for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>Overall it's a good sign to see so many communities making the jump to Matrix and sticking around ❤️</p>

<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>

</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We’ve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we’ll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one "high level command", <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this project useful 🙂</p>

<p>Soru made a new thing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Sorunome/matrix-gotify">matrix-gotify</a>. It is a <a href="https://gotify.net/">gotify</a> plugin to receive matrix notifications. This means, you can now receive matrix push notifications on your android phone self-hosted without the need of google services! That is why putting the full event in the push notification is actually not a privacy leak in this case.</p>
<p>This plugin could also be used to receive push notifications on any other kind of device that gotify supports.</p>
<p>Please note that this is independent of any matrix client - you don't even need to run one to be able to use this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked whether an <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a>-like solution be
built on top of this , and Sorunome responded that someone had already
started working on just that! https://github.com/gotify/android/pull/115</p>
<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it — until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues — such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> — it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score — it's probably not your fault. :)</p>

this VoIP tester was part of it, but he's still working on it in his spare

                <p>On April 14th, the Spec Core Team conducted a long-overdue retrospective
about the things that were working in the
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Proposal process</a>,
and those that were not.</p>
<p>The most glaring item on the list was the sluggish pace that many Matrix
Spec Changes (MSCs) take throughout the proposal process, as well as the
general lack of activity from the Spec Core Team members on proposals that
have not yet started a Final Comment Period.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the frustration this has likely caused many MSC
authors, and want to shed some light on the reasoning behind it, and what we
plan to do to prevent leaving authors in the dark about why there may be no
Spec Core Team activity on their proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-triaging">Proposal Triaging</h2>
<p>There are currently 136 open MSCs that have yet to undergo Final Comment
Period (FCP), 75 of which are marked as proposal-in-review, and 20 that have
a FCP proposed. Relative to the 65 MSCs that have ever been closed, this is a
lot of outstanding ideas, features and maintenance changes.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team itself is made up of 8 members, each of which have
separate full-time jobs. All team members are well-placed to be on the team
given their wide breadth of knowledge across the Matrix ecosystem,
however the majority are some of the most busy pushing forward Matrix's
reference implementations - without which, Matrix will unquestionably fail.
This limits the amount of MSCs that the team can effectively work on at a
given time.</p>
<p>The team understands that there are MSCs that provide incredibly useful
features, such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2191">support for LaTeX in messages</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">the ability to "knock" on rooms</a>,
and would undoubtedly like to see them land at some point.</p>
<p>But there is also a large backlog of MSCs that provide even more fundamental
fixes and additions to the protocol that the team needs to prioritise. These
include things like
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2472">cross-signing devices</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">the communities rewrite</a> and
finally merging
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">reactions and edits</a> into the spec.</p>
<p>While we announce what MSCs we're focusing on during a given week during
<a href="https://matrix.org/twim">TWIM</a>, it's not as clear which items we're looking
to pull from the backlog next. To help tackle this, and to help keep us
honest, we've begun putting each MSC into either "feature", "maintenance", or
"core" buckets. This materialises in the form of github tags, which can be
used to filter the list of MSCs like so:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Afeature">feature</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Amaintenance">maintenance</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Acore">core</a>.
For a given timespan, we’ll pick a track and pull MSCs out of that category
when possible. More information about MSC categories are now detailed on
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals#categories">the proposals page</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to work on items from the “core”
category. We need to get Matrix to a point where it can compete with other,
proprietary chat protocols and items in "core" are decidedly the proposals
that will take us the furthest in that direction. This doesn't mean we won't
occasionally look at an MSC in a different category, but it will heavily
influence our prioritisation.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>We'll try this approach out over the next few months and see how it goes. The
next Spec Core Team retro will occur in the middle of May, where we will
review the process once again.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any feedback please come and chat with us in

                <p>It’s that time of year again! Matrix.org is once again participating in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. We have been allocated four student slots by Google this year, and narrowing the 18 proposals we received down to just four was a very difficult task.</p>
<p>In the end, we have decided on the following four students and their proposed projects:</p>
<p>Alexey Andreyev’s proposal involves adding end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for future support in Qt/libQMatrixClient-based clients such as <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/">Spectral</a>. They will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, lead developer of libQMatrixClient, and our own end-to-end encryption expert, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a>.</p>
<p>Kai Hiller’s proposal for more reliable third-party protocol <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridges">bridges</a> includes adding the ability to notify the user when a message fails to reach its final destination despite being accepted by the bridge. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@half-shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>.</p>
<p>Eisha Chen-yen-su’s proposal for Matrix Visualisations aims to “develop a tool which will visualise the event Directed Acyclic Graph data structure which describes the conversation history in a room. It will be a real-time visualisation of the DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more HomeServers (HSes).” They state that “this tool will be useful for debugging or administration of Matrix HSes by making people able to easily see how the federation process works”. They have already posted prototypes of their tool in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>, and it’s all written in Rust! Which makes their mentor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@erikj:jki.re">erikj</a>, very happy.</p>
<p>And finally, Cnly’s proposal for working towards completion of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>’s Client-Server API. The proposal also touches on general improvements to the codebase and increasing test coverage. Cnly will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">babolivier</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the selected students. We look forward to participating with you on completing your project over the course of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>If your proposal was not selected, do not give up hope! Being an active member of the Matrix community and having a deep understanding of the ecosystem and its projects is a big part of what we look for when choosing candidates. If you stick around, you have a strong chance of being chosen in a subsequent year.</p>
<p>We will not be sharing individual’s proposal documents, but students are free to share them as they please.</p>
