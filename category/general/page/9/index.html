                <p style="text-align: left;">Hi folks,</p>
Thought it was worth giving a quick status update on what's going on since our <a href="/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/">last blog post</a>, which explained the funding situation Matrix has found itself in.  The TL;DR is that we're still here; things are moving faster than ever (not least as we refocus on getting everything needed to get Matrix funded and sustainable in the longer term), but we still need concrete support from the community (both company sponsorship and personal donations) to ensure things keep going at the current rate.
<h3 id="funding-status">Funding Status</h3>
<p>So, the good news is that we had a great initial response to last week's call to help - right now we have 199 people signed up on <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> (go on, be the 200th! you know you want to :D), ~30 on <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg/">Liberapay</a>, and 14 bitcoin donations.  This sums up to just over $2000/month - which is getting close to our initial Patreon goal of $2500/month to helping support half the cost of the less senior devs working on Matrix. <strong>Endless thanks to everyone who has donated - especially the 19 folks (18 on Patreon, one on Liberapay) who have so generously pledged $50 or more a month!! </strong>Meanwhile, if you're reading this and you haven't pledged support yet - <em>please</em> consider heading over to <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> or Bitcoin 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE and helping keep the project running.  Literally every dollar counts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while Patreon &amp; friends are headed in the right direction to support one developer, we still have another 10 people working on all the various core components of Matrix itself who need to be supported in the near future.  (We look to be safe for the next month or two, but beyond that we're counting on having solved this problem ;).  <strong>Right now we are hoping that companies who believe in Matrix and/or are building services on top will step up to sponsor development</strong> - as it's pretty obvious that accelerating Dendrite, final E2E, Groups etc will improve professional Matrix-based services immeasurably.  If this sounds like you, please <a href="mailto:matthew@matrix.org">get in touch</a> asap.</p>
<p>We're also able to provide <strong>paid consulting and development (and prioritised development)</strong> services on Matrix (through Vector, the for-profit company responsible for Riot) for large pieces of work - for instance, if you're anxious to see enterprise-focused Matrix features land sooner than later, please <a href="mailto:matthew@matrix.org">reach out</a>.</p>
<p>Exciting news is that we already have one concrete offer of paid consulting work from a very major company who happens to love Matrix, building out Integrations capabilities which should directly benefit the wider Matrix ecosystem - and we also are very proud to announce our very first official corporate sponsor (see the next section for details)!  However, we still have a long way to go, so don't be shy about getting in touch: <strong>we need your support</strong>!</p>
<p>Heads up that we've also started our various reward schemes for supporters - folks donating more than $5 on Patreon will have already heard most of this update in the first episode of the video blog that Amandine &amp; I posted last Friday; and folks donating more than $10 will have heard some of the other details first hand through the broadcast of the global team weekly sync on Monday!  We're still figuring out how to get these rewards over to liberapay &amp; bitcoin supporters (not helped by both services being anonymous...).  We haven't yet opened up the #matrix-supporters:matrix.org room as maintaining the accesslist is effectively blocked on Groups landing.  We also want to use Groups to manage the various lists of supporters around the place, so apologies that we haven't got the lists published yet!</p>
<p>Finally on the funding side of things: we're setting up the Matrix.org Foundation non-profit legal entity this week, letting us accept donations and sponsorship in a way which can directly fund the core developers (more details as we have them).  As soon as it's incorporated, we'll be able to sign up fully on Liberapay to accept donations there.</p>
<h3 id="announcing-upcloud-our-very-first-official-matrix-org-corporate-sponsor">Announcing <strong>UpCloud</strong>: our very first official Matrix.org Corporate Sponsor!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.upcloud.com/matrix"><img style="padding: 1em" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/upcloud-logo-horizontal-300x60.png" alt="" width="300" height="60" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2631" /></a></p>
<p>As hinted above, we're incredibly excited and happy that UpCloud have signed up as our first official corporate sponsor.  UpCloud has already been hosting all of Matrix.org's infrastructure for the last 6 months (no mean feat, given the scale of the Matrix.org synapse &amp; postgres!) - and last week they committed to extend their sponsorship further to help the project out in our time of need.</p>
<p>We've been very impressed with UpCloud's service since migrating over back in February - particularly their spectacularly fast block IO (<b>~350MB/s write, 92,000 IOPS, and over 5GB/s read!!</b>) which is incredibly useful for running a huge synapse deployment like Matrix.org's - and they have a great footprint of datacentres around the world.</p>
<p>They also like Matrix so much that they've written this <a href="https://www.upcloud.com/support/install-matrix-synapse/">great tutorial for getting Synapse up and running on their hosts</a> - and best of all, they have a special $25 discount for anyone in the Matrix community who wishes to use them: check out <a href="https://www.upcloud.com/matrix/">https://www.upcloud.com/matrix/</a> for the details!</p>
<p>We'd like to thank them profusely for being first in line to support us - and we look forward to seeing how far we can push their hardware over the coming months! :D</p>
<h3 id="development-status">Development Status</h3>
<p>Finally, loads and loads of stuff is happening on Matrix itself.  The main headlines are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Groups</strong>.  Work in Synapse and matrix-react-sdk is happening at breakneck speed to get Groups out the door as soon as possible, so we can use them both to support the funding drive and in general to implement one of the most asked-for features of Matrix: the ability to group rooms together into a well-defined community (similar to Slack Teams or Discord Servers etc).  The way Groups work is to let users define groupings of both users and rooms; you can also define a metadata for the group to let you build homepages similar to the one which Riot/Web sprouted a few months ago.  You can then refer to the group of users when inviting/banning/kicking etc - or when managing your own roomlist.  We think it's going to completely change how people use Matrix, and can't wait to see it land on riot.im/develop, although it's still a few weeks away.</li>
 	<li><strong>E2E Crypto</strong>.  We have three main things remaining here, after which E2E should be much much more usable for day-to-day purposes:
<ol>
 	<li>Fixing the matrix-js-sdk to store crypto state in indexeddb rather than localstorage, to prevent multiple browser tabs racing and corrupting localstorage (which provides no locking mechanism).  This turns out to be much more of an epic than we thought, as indexeddb's APIs are all strictly async, resulting in a whole bunch of previously synchronous APIs in matrix-js-sdk needing to become async too, as well as requiring us to switch promises library at least from Q to Bluebird.  However, most of this is now done so hopefully the new storage layer will land shortly. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2325"> https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2325</a> is the bug tracking this one...</li>
 	<li>Fixing the overall UX of managing devices in a room (including key shares). <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/4522"> https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/4522</a> is the bug for this one :)  Relatedly we also need to ensure invitees can decrypt messages in e2e rooms before they join (if history visibility allows it) - this is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/3821">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/3821</a></li>
 	<li>Fixing the UX of verifying devices (including cross-signing devices), to minimise the pain in verifying device ownership. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2142">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2142</a> is the master bug for this.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Integrations.  </strong>A large slice of the team is working on our next-generation integration hosting platform, which is starting to look unspeakably awesome.  We'll be yelling loudly about this once there's something to see and play with...
<strong>
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Rich Text Editor</strong>.  This was originally a GSoC project from last year, but is finally on by default now in matrix-react-sdk - letting users author their messages with full WYSIWYG behaviour and critically have a radically improved autocompletion UI/UX, including emoji, user names, room names, etc.  You can check it out at <a href="https://riot.im/develop">riot.im/develop</a> already :)</li>
 	<li><strong>Mentions</strong>.  We're finally semantically tagging references to users in messages so that they can be displayed nicely in the UI, and help with highlighting notifications!  This is due as soon as the Rich Text Editor work has finished.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mobile SDKs</strong>.  The iOS & Android teams are currently on a mission to get parity between the iOS & Android SDKs and matrix-react-sdk.  This is stuff like implementing the new User Search API; Membership Event List Summaries; Dark theme(!); Translations; etc.  Progress is looking good!</li>
 	<li><strong>Synapse performance</strong>.  Many many optimisations when calculating push rules when sending messages, which was taking up a substantial amount of the send path time.  Synapse develop looks to have reduced this significantly now - and as of Monday we're running the new optimisations on Matrix.org.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dendrite.  </strong>Lots of work going into implementing Invitations currently, including improvements to the overall append-only log architecture to support them nicely.</li>
 	<li><strong>Riot-Static</strong>.  This is one of our GSoC projects this year, written by Michael Telatynski (t3chguy) - providing a full static (no-JS) read-only view of Matrix, suitable for dumb web browsers and search engines.  It's looking really exciting (although needs CSS) - there's a copy currently deployed over at <a href="https://stormy-bastion-98790.herokuapp.com/">https://stormy-bastion-98790.herokuapp.com/</a>.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, there's a tonne of stuff happening in the community - an excellent summary may be found at this <a href="https://www.uhoreg.ca/blog/20170714-0834">Community Round Up blog post by uhoreg</a>!
<p>So: this is where things stand right now - the team is sprinting away getting all the stuff above landed, and meanwhile I'm spending most of my life worrying about funding.  We'll try to keep blogging more regularly to give better visibility on progress on both the funding &amp; development situation, as well as to ensure there's a written public record as well as the regular supporter-only updates.  However, for the latest realtime updates and sneak previews and tidbits you'll probably want to sign up on <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> :D</p>

<p>[EDIT: I got the UpCloud stats completely wrong - they are even faster (by 10x!) than I quoted; the figures are now updated :)]</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p><b>TL;DR: if you like Matrix (and especially if you're building stuff on it), please <i>support us via <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg/">Liberapay</a></i> to keep the core team able to work on it full-time, otherwise the project is going to be seriously impacted.  And if you're a company who is invested in Matrix (e.g. itching for Dendrite), please get in touch ASAP if you'd like to sponsor core development work from the team.  And if you're a philanthropic billionaire who believes in our ideals of decentralisation, encryption, and open communication as a basic human right - we'd love to hear from you too O:-)</b></p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2611" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/matrix-supporters-1024x248.png" alt="" width="1024" height="248" />
<p>I was expecting this blog post to be the Matrix Summer Special, focusing entirely on the incredible progress and updates we've made in the last few months in Matrix.  However, instead I'm going to talk about something different and literally critical to Matrix's success.</p>
<p>As many people know, Matrix.org development has historically been exclusively and very generously sponsored by a large multinational telecoms infrastructure company for whom most of the core team once built telco messaging apps.  However, despite the project progressing better than ever (more on that later), we have just had our funding dramatically cut by &gt;60%. <b>[Update: as of Aug 2017 it is effectively cut entirely, with enough $ left over to cover until end of October.]</b></p>
<p>We seem to be suffering from a darkly amusing paradox, as the rationale from our corporate overlords is essentially: <i>“Wow! Matrix is doing great and growing well - and you seem to have all sorts of exciting people and companies using and building on it.  But we've been footing the whole development bill since the outset in May 2014, and this simply doesn't feel fair.  We're happy to keep funding though - but only if others do too!”</i>.  In other words, in some ways we are a victim of our own success...</p>
<p>So we now find ourselves in the situation that despite the project looking better than ever and having a tonne of amazing stuff in the pipeline, we are suddenly missing the funding to keep the core team working on it.  And the team is quite sizeable - reflecting the ambition and size of Matrix: right now we have effectively 11 people working specifically on Matrix itself: 1 on Synapse, 1 on Dendrite, 1 on e2e crypto, 2 on matrix-react-sdk (which powers Riot/Web), 2 on matrix-ios-kit / matrix-ios-sdk, 2 on matrix-android-sdk, 1 on bridges, and me (Matthew) managing the overall project.  (This ignores folks who overlap the team who are working specifically on Riot stuff).</p>
<p>Over the last few years we've had countless people ask if they can financially support Matrix. We haven't been able to accept it for various reasons, but now is the time for us to step towards a more independent setup, and avoid a repeat of the situation we're currently facing by opening up to external support.</p>
<p><b>So we need help from the community to keep going!  </b><b>Please head over to <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a></b><b> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg/">Liberapay </a>and put some money in the meter </b>(or send some bitcoin to 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE or ether to 0xA5f9a4f9E024F6D727f7afdA9257e22329A97485)<b>.</b> In return, you'll get to keep Matrix evolving at a decent rate, be a member of the upcoming <code>+supporters:matrix.org</code> group (complete with flair badges!), and other benefits like access to #matrix-supporters:matrix.org - a new dedicated room for prioritised support, discounted goodies from Riot once paid services arrive, access to a weekly supporters-only status podcast(!), and of course receive our eternal thanks. :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <b>if you're a company who depends on Matrix</b>: <a href="mailto:matthew@matrix.org">please get in touch</a>. We have the option for you to sponsor core Matrix development (e.g. Dendrite) or for us to provide you with more targeted support or feature development.  We're already talking to several organisations who want to accelerate Dendrite specifically - and the more support we have there the faster we can go.</p>
<p>We'd also like to thank <a href="https://upcloud.com">UpCloud</a> for sponsoring hosting for the Matrix.org synapse instances - UpCloud has been coping impressively with the massive I/O and CPU/RAM requirements we have, and we recommend them unreservedly for <a href="https://upcloud.com/matrix">folks looking to run their own homeservers</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the longer term plans to help fund Matrix is to get sponsorship from Riot, once Riot starts offering paid services. So, <b>if you're an investor who's interested in the for-profit sides of Riot </b>(paid integrations and paid Matrix hosting) then please <a href="mailto:amandine@riot.im">get in touch with the Riot team</a> ASAP!</p>
<p>Moving forward we are confident that we can secure funding, through sponsorship and Riot paid services, but in truth this decision caught us by surprise and so we need help both long term but also <b><i>right now!</i></b></p>
<p>And whatever the funding situation, we're of course always looking for contributions for code, bug reports, or just spreading the word about the project too! :)</p>
<h2 id="status-update">Status Update</h2>
<p><strong><em>(or scroll to next section to see why this is bigger than "just" decentralised encrypted communication)</em></strong></p>
<p>Despite the funding issue, the project really is going very well. Our vital stats (as seen through the lens of the matrix.org synapse) are looking like this:</p>

<p>And meanwhile, looking back at the last big update (<a href="/blog/2016/12/26/the-matrix-holiday-special-2016-edition/">Holiday Special 2016</a>), we can compare our progress with our goals for 2017 thus far:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Getting E2E Encryption out of beta ASAP.</em></li>
</ul>
This has progressed massively - we haven't really yelled about it yet, but latest https://riot.im/develop/ now finally implements the ability to share message keys between clients to let them decrypt older history and fix “unable to decrypt” errors (Mobile coming soon).  Meanwhile various root causes of “unable to decrypt” errors have been gradually eliminated; I can't actually remember the last time I saw one! Once key-sharing and improved device verification UX is fully tested and tuned we should be able to declare E2E out of beta.
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Work on fixing the final causes of "unable to decrypt" (UISI) errors in E2E is progressing well: here's a sneak preview of things to come!! <a href="https://t.co/0oGJjm8ZHT">pic.twitter.com/0oGJjm8ZHT</a></p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Ensuring we can scale beyond Synapse – i.e. implement Dendrite</em></li>
</ul>
Likewise, Dendrite is on track: we've implemented all the Hard Stuff which forms the skeleton of Dendrite (core federation, message signing, /sync, message sending, media repository etc) - which takes us to over <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkMNpIpPjvuDJWjPFbw_xzNzOHBA-Hp50Rkpcr43xTw/edit">50% of Phase 1</a>. After phase 1, we will have an initial usable release for all the core functionality.  Synapse's performance has also improved enormously this year.
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">New milestone for Dendrite: sending messages over federation BOTH WAYS between dendrite & synapse! A bit more polish & we can cut an alpha!! <a href="https://t.co/DWs6rFqZcQ">pic.twitter.com/DWs6rFqZcQ</a></p>
<p>— Matrix (@matrixdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/878279397106733056">June 23, 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Getting as many bots and bridges into Matrix as possible, and doing everything we can to support them, host them and help them be as high quality as possible – making the public federated Matrix network as useful and diverse as possible.</em></li>
</ul>
Bridges and bots continue - from the core team we have a ‘puppeting' Telegram bridge (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-tg">matrix-appservice-tg</a>), and from the wider community we have <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-skype">Skype</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-signal">Signal</a>, new Rocket.Chat and more.  Getting them polished and live is certainly an area where we need more manpower though.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Supporting Riot's leap to the mainstream, ensuring Matrix has at least one killer app.</em></li>
</ul>
Riot has been <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-web-and-desktop-version-0-10-0-is-here-e6147f5f576f">sprouting</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-web-0-11-is-here-3edbf9dbb7ed">new releases</a> every few weeks, with a huge emphasis on proving UX:
<ul>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">an entirely new streamlined sign-up process</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">the new concept of home pages</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">a user directory search that actually works</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">internationalised to 27 languages</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">compact layout</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">loads of desktop improvements</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">piwik analytics support; etc.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2598" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-06-at-16.12.28-1024x566.png" alt="" width="1024" height="566" />
<p>There is still a lot of UX work to be done, but it's converging fast on being a great entry point into the Matrix ecosystem, driving its growth across different groups and communities..</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-unveils-the-next-generation-of-its-mobile-client-6b38e2227ee2">massive update to the iOS &amp; Android apps</a> just landed yesterday, switching to an entirely new UI layout to separate People from Rooms, synchronized Read Markers, and more!</p>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Adding the final major missing features:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Customisable User Profiles (this is almost done, actually)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
This is still hovering at ‘almost done', and will be needed for some of the implementation of Groups (see below)..
<ul>
 	<li><em>Groups (i.e. ability to define groups of users, and perform invites, powerlevels, etc. per-group as well as per-user)</em></li>
</ul>
Groups are also in testing in Synapse too!  These will probably be the single biggest change to Matrix that we've seen since E2E encryption landed: it changes the dynamic of the whole network, given users can explicitly declare allegiance to different groups, which in turn have their own home pages and directories etc.  It lets users form communities, and declare their participation in those communities (if desired), and also lets rooms be grouped together.  One of our single biggest requests has been <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2454">“subrooms”</a> and we're incredibly excited to see how well Groups solve this.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Threading</em></li>
</ul>
Sadly no progress on Threading so far this year.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Editable events (and Reactions)</em></li>
</ul>
We're hoping to get looking at this (at last!) once Groups are done.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Maturing and polishing the spec (we are way overdue a new release)</em></li>
</ul>
You'll have noticed that in the “how many people work on Matrix?” stats above, we didn't mention anyone working on the Spec.  Because right now there isn't anyone explicitly maintaining it, unfortunately; updates are done best-effort when everyone's primary responsibilities allow it.  That said, there's quite a lot of good stuff currently <a href="/speculator/spec/HEAD/client_server/unstable.html">unreleased on HEAD.</a> This is something which is obviously critical to fix once we have sustainable funding sorted again.  We can only apologise to folks like the <a href="https://ruma.dev/">Ruma</a> developers who have suffered from the spec lag. :(
<ul>
 	<li><em>Improving VoIP – especially conferencing.</em></li>
</ul>
VoIP is improving lots on iOS, thanks to Denis Morozov's GSoC project, and meanwhile we have all new conferencing powered by Jitsi on the horizon in the next few weeks too.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Reputation/Moderation management (i.e. spam/abuse filtering).</em></li>
</ul>
Lots of thinking about this (see below), but no development yet.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Much-needed SDK performance work on matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk.</em></li>
</ul>
About 40% of the desired performance work has happened here (although not all has gone live yet).
<ul>
 	<li><em>…and a few other things which would be premature to mention right now. :D</em></li>
</ul>
All will be revealed in the next week or two - but suffice it to say that Integrations are going to be getting a Lot More Useful™. :)
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>There are very very few people actually working professionally on trying to build general-purpose open communication networks and protocols.  There's us, some <a href="http://xmpp.org">XMPP</a>, <a href="http://ircv3.net/">IRCv3</a> and <a href="https://gnu.io/social/">GNU Social</a>/<a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a> folks, <a href="https://ring.cx/">GNU Ring</a>, <a href="http://tox.chat">Tox</a>, <a href="http://briarproject.org">Briar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ssbc">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="http://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="http://status.im">Status.im</a>, <a href="http://ricochet.im">Ricochet</a>… and that's literally all the major projects I can think of (sorry if I missed you!).  There's probably only 50 developers in total working in this domain as their day job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are literally <strong><i>hundreds of thousands </i></strong>of folks trudging away building more and more near-indistinguishable proprietary closed communication systems - trapping users inside ever more silos and fragmenting the basic ability to communicate on the ‘net.  It's like a world where the open web was pushed into a tiny underground resistance, and everyone else was trapped in the walled gardens of AOL and Compuserve (or more contemporarily: Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc).</p>
<p>In other words: the whole world of decentralised communication desperately needs your support.  This is a clear case of user choice and freedom: to give users the ability to pick who they trust with their data and metadata, without being forced into unilaterally trusting the Silicon Valley megacorps.  And this, dear Reader, is your chance to fix the world for the greater good. Seriously, the Matrix team is one of a handful in the world in a position to continue to push things in the right direction and avoid us falling into a permanent dystopia where communication is even more closed and proprietary than the Public Telephone Network!</p>
<p>Finally, there's an even bigger issue at stake here than open communication.  As an open network, people can literally publish whatever content they like into Matrix - same as the web or the internet itself.  As a result, there's scope for spam; abusive/malicious content; propaganda; and generally the whole spectrum of the best and worst of humanity.  Now, if we were a centralised system like Facebook, we might hire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/facebook-moderators-quick-guide-job-challenges">thousands of content moderators</a> to frantically impose a rulebook on ‘acceptable' content.  Or we might build invisible filter-bubbles for our users based on their social graph, cocooning them from scary unfamiliar content outside their social circles and reinforcing their preconceptions (whilst the resulting self-affirmation keeps them coming back, viewing more and more ads).</p>
<p>But we're decentralised, and we have no absolute moral arbiter, and nor should we - on an open network it should be up to users and users alone to define and manage their own worldview and alignment.  Plus we are not fiscally obligated to keep users coming back to view more ads no matter what.  Instead, we are forced to confront the fundamental problem: building tools which empower users to curate and visualise their own content filters; letting them filter out the stuff they're not interested in or find repellant… while still helping them be aware of their own viewpoint and the shape of the world beyond it.  We haven't really started building this yet, but in the long term our feeling is that these tools will literally be vital for the survival of the human race (e.g. exposing anti-climate-change propaganda for what it is or helping users opt out of World War 3) - let alone the success of decentralisation.  A world where users blindly consume propaganda is doomed, and it's a fascinating situation that the same tools which will allow Matrix users to tune out the rooms, users and conversations they're not interested in could be directly applied to the bigger global problem.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've released Synapse 0.19.3-rc2 as 0.19.3 with no changes. This is a slightly unusual release, as 0.19.3-rc2 dates from March 13th and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/672dcf5...d101488">a lot of stuff</a> has landed on the develop branch since then - however, we'll be releasing that as 0.20.0 once it's ready. Instead, 0.19.3 has a set of intermediary performance and bug fixes; the only new feature is a set of admin APIs kindly contributed by <a href="https://github.com/morteza-araby">@morteza-araby</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog follows - please upgrade from https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse or your OS packages as normal :)</p>

                <p>Hi everyone. I'm Kegan, one of the core developers at matrix.org. This is the first in a series on the matrix.org IRC bridge. The aim of this series is to try to give a behind the scenes look at how the IRC bridge works, what kinds of problems we encountered, and how we plan to scale in the future. This post looks at how the IRC bridge actually works.</p>
<p>Firstly, what is "bridging"? The simple answer is that it is a program which maps between different messaging protocols so that users on different protocols can communicate with each other. Some protocols may have features which are not supported in the other (typing notifications in Matrix, DCC - <em>direct</em> file transfers - in IRC). This means that bridging will always be "inferior" to just using the respective protocol. That being said, where there is common ground a bridge can work well; all messaging protocols support sending and receiving text messages for example. As we'll see however, the devil is in the detail...</p>
<p>A lot of existing IRC bridges for different protocols share one thing in common: they use a single global bot to bridge traffic. This bot listens to all messages from IRC, and sends them to the other network. The bot also listens for messages from users on the other network, and sends messages on their behalf to IRC. This is a lot easier than having to maintain dedicated TCP connections for each user. However, it isn't a great experience for IRC users as they:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Don't know who is reading messages on a channel as there is just 1 bot in the membership list.</li>
 	<li>Cannot PM users on the other network.</li>
 	<li>Cannot kick/ban users on the other network without affecting everyone else.</li>
 	<li>Cannot bing/mention users on the other network easily (tab completion).</li>
</ul>
We made the decision very early on that we would keep dedicated TCP connections for each Matrix user. This means every Matrix user has their own tiny IRC client. This has its own problems:
<ul>
 	<li>It involves multiple connections to the IRCd so you need special permission to set up an i:line.</li>
 	<li>You need to be able to support identification of individual users (via ident or unique IPv6 addresses).</li>
 	<li>With all these connections to the same IRC channels, you need to have some way to identify which incoming messages have already been handled and which have not.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mapping-rooms">Mapping Rooms</h3>
<p>So now that we have a way to send and receive messages, how do we map the rooms/channels between protocols? This isn't as easy as you may think. We can have a single static one-to-one mapping:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>All messages to <code>#channel</code> go to <code>!abcdef:matrix.org</code>.</li>
 	<li>All messages from <code>!abcdef:matrix.org</code> go to <code>#channel</code>.</li>
 	<li>All PMs between <code>@alice:matrix.org</code> and Bob go to <code>!wxyz:matrix.org</code> and the respective PM on IRC.</li>
</ul>
In order to make PMs secure, we need to limit who can access the room. This is done by making the Matrix PM room "invite-only". This can cause problems though if the Matrix user ever leaves that room: they won't be able to ever re-join! The IRC bridges get around this by allowing Matrix users to <em>replace</em> their dedicated PM room with a new room, and by checking to make sure that the Matrix user is inside the room before sending messages.
<p>Then you have problem of "ownership" of rooms. Who should be able to kick users in a bridged room? There are two main scenarios to consider:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The IRC channel has existed for a while and there are existing IRC channel operators.</li>
 	<li>The IRC channel does not exist, but there are existing Matrix moderators.</li>
</ul>
In the first case, we want to defer ownership to the channel operators. This is what happens by default for all bridged IRC channels on matrix.org. The Matrix users have no power in the room, and are at the mercy of the IRC channel operators. The channel operators are represented by virtual Matrix users in the room. However, they do not have any power level: they are at the same level as real Matrix users. Why? The bridge does this because, unlike IRC, it's not possible in Matrix to bring a user to the same level as yourself (e.g <code>+o</code>), and then downgrade them back to a regular user (e.g. <code>-o</code>). Instead, the bridge bot itself acts as a custodian for the room, and performs privileged IRC operations (topic changing, kickbans, etc) on the IRC channel operator's behalf.
<p>In the second case, we want to defer ownership to the Matrix moderators. This is what happens when you "provision a room" in Matrix. The bridge will PM a currently online channel operator and ask for their permission to bridge to Matrix. If they accept, the bridge is made and the power levels in the pre-existing Matrix room are left untouched, giving moderators in Matrix control over the room. However, this power doesn't extend completely to IRC. If a Matrix moderator grants moderator powers to another Matrix user, this will not be mapped to IRC. Why? It's not possible for the bridge to give chanops to any random user on any random IRC channel, so it cannot always honour the request. This relies on the humans on either side of the bridge to communicate and map power accordingly. This is done on purpose as there is no 100% perfect mapping between IRC powers and Matrix powers: it's always going to need to compromise which only a human can make.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the problem of one-to-many mappings. It is possible to have two Matrix rooms bridged to the same IRC channel. The problem occurs when a Matrix user in one room speaks. The bridge can easily map that to IRC, but unless it <em>also</em> maps it back to Matrix, the message will never make it to the 2nd Matrix room. The bridge cannot control/puppet the Matrix user who spoke, so instead it creates a virtual Matrix user to represent that <em>real</em> Matrix user and then sends the message into the 2nd Matrix room. Needless to say, this can be quite confusing and we strongly discourage one-to-many mappings for this reason.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-messages">Mapping Messages</h3>
<p>Mapping Matrix messages to IRC is rather easy for the most part. Messages are passed from the Homeserver to the bridge via the AS API, and the bridge sends a textual representation of the message to IRC using the IRC connection for that Matrix user. The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/258">exact form</a> of the text for images, videos and long text can be quite subjective, and there is inevitably some data loss along the way. For example, you can send big text headings, tables and lists in Matrix, but there is no equivalent on IRC. Thankfully, most Matrix users are sending the corresponding markdown and so the formatting can be reasonably preserved by just sending the plaintext (markdown) body.</p>
<p>Mapping IRC messages to Matrix is more difficult: not because it's hard to represent the message in Matrix, but because of the architecture of the bridge. The bridge maintains separate connections for each Matrix user. This means the bridge might have, for example, 5 users (and hence connections) on the <em>same channel</em>. When an IRC user sends a message, the bridge gets 5 copies of the message. How does the bridge know:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>If the message has already been sent?</li>
 	<li>If the message is an intentional duplicate?</li>
</ul>
The IRC protocol does not have message IDs, so the bridge cannot de-duplicate messages as they arrive. Instead, it "nominates" a single user's connection to be responsible for delivering messages from that channel. This introduces another problem though. Long-lived TCP connections are fickle things, and can fail without any kind of visible warning until you try to send bytes down it. If a user's connection drops, another user needs to take over responsibility for delivering messages. This is what the "IRC Event Broker" class does. It allows users to "steal" messages if the bridge has any indication that the connection in charge has dropped. This technique has worked well for us, and gives us the ability to have more robust connections to the channel than with one TCP connection alone.
<h3 id="admin-rooms">Admin Rooms</h3>
<p>Admin rooms are private Matrix rooms between a real Matrix user and the bridge bot. It allows the Matrix user to control their connection to IRC. It allows:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The IRC nick to be changed.</li>
 	<li>The ability to issue /whois commands.</li>
 	<li>The ability to bypass the bridge and send raw IRC commands directly down the TCP connection (e.g. MODE commands).</li>
 	<li>The ability to save a NickServ password for use when the bridge reconnects you.</li>
 	<li>The ability to disconnect from the network entirely.</li>
</ul>
To perform these actions, Matrix users send a text message which starts with a command name, e.g <code>!whois $ARG</code>. Like all commands, you expect to get a reply once you've issued it. However, IRC makes this extremely difficult to do. There is no request/response pair like there is with HTTP requests. Instead, the IRC server may:
<ul>
 	<li>Ignore the request entirely.</li>
 	<li>Send an error you're aware of (in the RFC/most servers)</li>
 	<li>Send some information which can be assumed to indicate success.</li>
 	<li>Send an error you're unaware of.</li>
 	<li>Send some information which <em>sometimes</em> indicates success.</li>
</ul>
This makes it very difficult to know if a request succeeded or failed, and I'll go into more detail in the next post which focuses on problems we've encountered when developing the IRC bridge. This room is also used to inform the Matrix user about general information about their IRC connection, such as when their connection has been lost, or if there are any errors (e.g. "requires chanops to do this action"). The bridge makes no effort to parse these errors, because it doesn't always know what caused the error to happen.
<h3 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h3>
<p>Developing a comprehensive IRC bridge is a very difficult task. This post has outlined a few of the ways in which we've designed our bridge, and some of the general problems in this field. The bridge is constantly improving as we discover new edge cases with the plethora of IRCd implementations out there. The next post will look at some of these edge cases and look back at some previous outages and examine why they occurred.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone! As of last week, we are now bridging irc.gimp.org (GIMPNet) for all your GTK+/GNOME needs! It's running a bleeding-edge version of the IRC bridge which supports basic chanops syncing from IRC to Matrix. This means that if an IRC user gives chanops to a Matrix connection, the bridge will give that Matrix user moderator privileges in the room, allowing them to set the room topic/avatar/alias/etc! We hope this will make customising Matrix-bridged rooms a lot easier.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Since FOSDEM we've seen even more interest in Matrix than normal, and we've been having some problems getting the Matrix.org homeserver to keep up with demand.  This has resulted in performance being slightly slower than normal at peak times, but the main impact has been the additional traffic exacerbating outages on the homeserver - either by revealing new failure modes, or making it harder to recover rapidly after something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Specifically: on Friday afternoon we had a service disruption caused by someone sending an unusual event into Matrix HQ.  It turns out that both matrix-android-sdk and matrix-ios-sdk based clients (e.g. Riot/Android and iOS) handled this naively by simply resyncing the room state... which has been fine in the past, but not when you have several hundred clients actively syncing the room, and resulted in a thundering herd effect which overloaded the server for ~10 mins or so whilst they all resynced the room (which, in turn, nowadays, involves calculating and syncing several MB of JSON state to each client).  The traffic load was then high enough that it took the server a further 10-20 minutes for the server to fully catch up and recover after the herd had dissipated.  We then had a repeat performance on Monday morning of the same failure mode.</p>
<p>Similarly, we had disruption last night after a user who hadn't used the service for ages logged on for the first time and rapidly caught up on a few rooms which literally had <em>millions</em> of unread messages in them.  Generally this would be okay, but the combination of loaded DB and the sheer number of notifications being deleted ended up with 4 long-running DB deletes in parallel.  This seems to have caused postgres to lock the event_actions_table more aggressively than we'd expect, blocking other queries which were trying to access it... causing most requests to block until the deletes were over.  At the current traffic volumes this meant that the main synapse process tried to serve thousands of simultaneous requests as they stacked up and ran out of filehandles within about 10 minutes and wedged the whole synapse solid before the DB could unblock.  Irritatingly, it turns out our end-to-end monitoring has a bug where it in turn can crash on receiving a 500 from synapse, so despite having PagerDuty all set up and running (and having been receiving pages for traffic delays over the last few weeks)... we didn't get paged when we got actual failed traffic rather than slow traffic, which delayed resolving the issue.  Finally, whilst rolling out a fix this afternoon, we again hit issues with the traffic load causing more problems than we were expecting, making a routine redeploy distinctly more disruptive.</p>
<p>So, what are we doing about this?</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Fix the root causes:
<ul>
 	<li>The 'android/iOS thundering herd' bug is being worked on both the android/iOS side (fixing the naive behaviour) and the server side.  A temporary mitigation is in now place which moves the server-side code to worker processes so that worst case it can't take out the main synapse process and can scale better.</li>
 	<li>The 'event_push_actions table is inefficient' bug had <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/1916">already been fixed</a> - so this was a matter of rushing through the hotfix to matrix.org before we saw a recurrence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Move to faster hardware.  Our current DB master is a "fast when we bought it 5 years ago" machine whose IO is simply starting to saturate (6x 300GB 10krpm disks in RAID5, fwiw), which is maxing out at around 500IOPS and 20MB/s of random access, and acting as a *very* hard limit to the current synapse performance.  We're currently in the process of evaluating SSD-backed IO for the DB (in fact, we're already running a DB slave), and assuming this tests out okay we're hoping to migrate next week, which should give us a 10x-20x speed up on disk IO and buy considerable headroom.  Watch this space for details.</li>
 	<li>Make synapse faster.  We're continuing to plug away at optimisations (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/1923">stuff like this</a>), but these are reaching the point of diminishing returns, especially relative to the win from faster hardware.</li>
 	<li>Fix the end-to-end monitoring.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrixmon/commit/9481da67b87c1d5142dbc76d9e4b6eb29c56398b">This already happened</a>.</li>
 	<li>Load-test before deploying.  This is hard, as you really need to test against precisely the same traffic profile as live traffic, and that's hard to simulate.  We're thinking about ways of fixing this, but the best solution is probably going to be clustering and being able to do incremental redeploys to gradually test new changes.  On which note:</li>
 	<li>Fix synapse's architectural deficiencies to support clustering, allowing for rolling zero-downtime redeploys, and better horizontal scalability to handle traffic spikes like this.  We're choosing not to fix this in synapse, but we are currently in full swing implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">dendrite</a> as a next-generation homeserver in Golang, architected from the outset for clustering and horizontal scalability.  N.B. most of the exciting stuff is happening on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/branches">feature branches</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib">gomatrixserverlib</a> atm. Also, we're deliberately taking the time to try to get it right this time, unlike bits of synapse which were something of a rush job.  It'll be a few weeks before dendrite is functional enough to even send a message (let alone finish the implementation), but hopefully faster hardware will give the synapse deployment on matrix.org enough headroom for us to get dendrite ready to take over when the time comes!</li>
</ol>
The good news of course is that you can run your own synapse today to avoid getting caught up in this operational fun & games, and unless you're planning to put tens of thousands of daily active users on the server you should be okay!
<p>Meanwhile, please accept our apologies for the instability and be assured that we're doing everything we can to get out this turbulence as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We're a little late with this, but Synapse 0.19.1 was released last week. The only change is a bugfix to a regression in room state replication that snuck in during the performance improvements that landed in 0.19.0. Please upgrade if you haven't already. We've also fixed the Debian repository to make installing Synapse easier on Jessie by including backported packages for stuff like Twisted where we're forced to use the latest releases.</p>
<p>You can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</a> as always.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>FOSDEM this year was even more crazy and incredible than ever - with attendance up from 6,000 to 9,000 folks, it's almost impossible to describe the atmosphere. Matt Jordan from Asterisk describes it as <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcjordan/status/827562586119958528">DisneyWorld for OSS Geeks</a>, but it's even more than that: it's basically a corporeal representation of the whole FOSS movement.  There is no entrance fee; there is no intrusive sponsorship; there is no corporate presence: it's just a venue for huge numbers of FOSS projects and their users and communities to come together in one place (the Université Libre de Bruxelles) and talk and learn.  Imagine if someone built a virtual world with storefronts for every open source project imaginable, where you could chat to the core team, geek out with other users, or gather in auditoriums to hear updates on the latest projects &amp; ideas.  Well, this is FOSDEM... except even better, it's in real life.  With copious amounts of Belgian beer.</p>
<p>Anyway: this year we had our normal stand on the 2nd floor of K building, sharing the Realtime Lounge chill-out space with the XMPP Standards Foundation.  This year we had a larger representation than ever before with Matthew, Erik and Luke from the London team as well as Manu &amp; Yannick from Rennes - which is just as well given all 5 of us ended up speaking literally non-stop from 10am to 6pm on both Saturday &amp; Sunday (and then into the night as proceedings deteriorated/evolved into an impromptu Matrix meetup with Coffee, uhoreg, tadzik, realitygaps and others!).  The level of interest at the Matrix booth was frankly phenomenal: a major change from the last two FOSDEMs in that this year pretty much everyone had already heard of Matrix, and were most likely to want to enthuse about features and bugs in Synapse or Riot, or geek out about writing new bridges/bots/clients, or trying to work out a way to incorporate Matrix into their own projects or companies.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/04/synapse-0-19-is-here-just-in-time-for-fosdem">Synapse 0.19</a> and Riot 0.9.7 were also released on Saturday to try to ensure that anyone joining Matrix for the best time at FOSDEM were on the latest &amp; greatest code - especially given the performance and E2E fixes present in both.  Amazingly the last-minute release didn't backfire: if you haven't upgraded to Synapse 0.19 we recommend going so asap.  And if you're a Riot user, make sure you're on the latest version :)</p>
<p>We were very lucky to have two talks accepted this year: the main one in the Security Track on the Jansen main stage telling the tale of <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/">how we added end-to-end encryption to Matrix</a>  via <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">Olm</a> &amp; <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">Megolm</a> - and the other in the Decentralised Internet room (AW1.125), focusing on the unsolved <a href="http://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future">future problems of decentralised accounts, identity, reputation in Matrix</a>.  Both talks were well attended, with huge queues for the Decentralised Internet room: we can only apologise to everyone who queued for 20+ minutes only to still not be able to get in.  Hopefully next year FOSDEM will allocate a larger room for decentralisation!  On the plus side, this year FOSDEM did an amazing job of videoing the sessions - livestreaming every talk, and automatically publishing the recordings (via a fantastic 'publish your own talk' web interface) - so many of the people who couldn't get into the room (as well as the rest of the world) were able to watch it live anyway by the stream.</p>

<p>You can watch the video of the talks from the FOSDEM website <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/">here</a> and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/">here</a>.  Both talks necessarily include the similar exposition for folks unfamiliar with Matrix, so apologies for the duplication - also, the "future of decentralised communication" talk ended up a bit rushed; 20 minutes is not a lot of time to both explain Matrix and give an overview of the challenges we face in fixing spam, identity, moderation etc.  But if you like hearing overenthusiastic people talking too fast about how amazing Matrix is, you may wish to check out the videos :)  You can also get at the slides as PDF <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-03.1-FOSDEM-Encrypting-Matrix.pdf">here (E2E Encryption)</a> and <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-04-FOSDEM-Future.pdf">here (Future of Decentralisation)</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to evevryone who came to the talks or came and spoke to us at the stand or around the campus.  We had an amazing time, and are already looking forward to next year!</p>

                <p>We seem to have fallen into the pattern of giving seasonal 'state of the union' updates on the Matrix blog, despite best intentions to blog more frequently... although given the <a href="/blog/2016/11/12/the-matrix-autumn-special/">Autumn Update</a> ended up being posted in November this one is going to be a relatively incremental update.  Let's jump straight in:</p>
<h3 id="e2e-encryption">E2E Encryption</h3>
<p>Unless you've been in a coma for the last month you'll have hopefully noticed that we <a href="/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/">launched the formal beta for E2E Encryption</a> across matrix-{'{'}js,ios,android{'}'}-sdk (and thus Riot/{'{'}Web, iOS, Android{'}'}) in November, complete with the successful <a href="http://nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review">independent public security assessment</a> of our Olm and Megolm cryptography library from NCC Group.  So far the beta has gone well in parts: the core Olm/Megolm crypto library has held up well with no bugfixes at all required since the audit (yay!).  However, we've hit a lot of different edge cases in the wild where devices can fail to share their outbound session ratchet state to other devices present in the room.  This results in the infamous "Unknown Inbound Session ID" (UISI) errors which many folks will have seen (now renamed to the more meaningful "Unable to decrypt: The sender's device has not sent us the keys for this message" error).</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's a bunch of entirely different causes for this, both platform-specific and cross-platform, and we've been running around untangling all the error reports and getting to the bottom of it.  The good news is that we think we now know the vast majority of the causes, and fixes are starting to land.  We've also just finished a fairly time-consuming formal crypto code-review on the three application SDK implementations (JS, iOS &amp; Android) to shake out any other issues.  Meanwhile some new features have also landed - e.g. the ability for guests to use E2E!  The remaining stuff at this point before we can consider declaring E2E out of beta is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Finish fixing the UISI errors (in progress)</li>
 	<li>Warn when unverified devices are added to a room</li>
 	<li>Implement passphrased backup & restore for E2E state, so that folks can avoid losing their E2E history when they logout or switch to a new device</li>
 	<li>Improve device verification.</li>
</ul>
Thanks to everyone who's been using E2E and reporting issues - given the number of different UISI error causes out there, it's been really useful to go through the different bug reports that folks have submitted.  Please continue to submit them when you see unexpected problems (especially over the coming months as stability improves!)
<h3 id="new-projects">New Projects!</h3>
<p>There have been a tonne of new projects popping up from all over the place since the last update.  Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/master/supporting-docs">git history</a> of the <a href="/docs/projects">projects page</a>, we've been adding one every few days!  Highlights include:</p>
<h4 id="bridges">Bridges:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kfatehi/matrix-appservice-imessage">https://github.com/kfatehi/matrix-appservice-imessage</a> - A solid foundation for an iMessage bridge from kfatehi, built on top of the official matrix-appservice-bridge stack.  iMessage and FaceTime's crypto is tied into Apple's Fairplay DRM (famous for securing the iTunes Music Store and App Store) and is locked all the way down to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">keypair baked into your Apple device's CPU</a> at fabrication time, so for now the bridge has to be run on a macOS device in order to bridge.  It's very promising indeed, and exciting to see bridges to relatively inhospitable environments like iMessage popping up!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-fb-chat/">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-fb-chat/</a> - A proof-of-concept bridge for Facebook Messenger written by Half-Shot in TypeScript on top of the matrix-js-sdk.  Currently you have to manually configure which conversations to bridge between FB and Matrix, but it works!</li>
 	<li><a href="http://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat">https://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat</a>  - A new Rocket.Chat bridge from exul, written in Rust.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/pztrn/matrix-xmpp-bridge">https://github.com/pztrn/matrix-xmpp-bridge</a> - A major fork from pztrn of jfred's matrix-xmpp-bridge, now using flask, regius, alembic, sleekxmpp and all sorts.  Currently in very active dev!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/CyrusTheHedgehog/Hangouts-Bridge">https://github.com/CyrusTheHedgehog/Hangouts-Bridge</a> - A basic PoC of a Hangouts bridge, written in python3 asyncio</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="clients">Clients</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/j">https://github.com/lukebarnard1/j</a> - A blogging and journalism platform built on Matrix from Luke (moonlighting from the core team!)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://live.hello-matrix.net/">https://live.hello-matrix.net/</a> - a live-blogging system powered by Matrix from @ar</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/pik/interlocutor">https://github.com/pik/interlocutor</a> - An experimental decentralized comment system powered by Matrix, written as a Polymer Webcomponent</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/tjgillies/freebird">https://github.com/tjgillies/freebird</a> - a basic twitter clone built on Matrix by tjgillies</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-projects">Other projects</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/slp/matrix-pushgw">https://github.com/slp/matrix-pushgw</a> - A Matrix push gateway written in Golang which exposes a custom TCP push protocol to apps, letting them get push notifications directly from your own gateway rather than via GCM or APNS.  The intention is to use it for Sailfish and Fdroid.  The initial implementation looks very promising - just needs the clientside support, and then folks who don't trust Google with their notifications can run completely indie at last!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kultsinuppeli/riotchat">https://github.com/kultsinuppeli/riotchat</a> - Ansible playbook for Riot/Web and Synapse</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/bismark/matrex">https://github.com/bismark/matrex</a> - Experimental beginnings of a Matrix homeserver written in Elixir!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/mlopezr/node-red-contrib-matrixbot">https://github.com/mlopezr/node-red-contrib-matrixbot</a> - Matrix bot plugin for the <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> IOT platform</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bots-and-bridges">Bots and Bridges</h3>
<p>There's been a bunch of work from the core team on bots &amp; bridges infrastructure over the last month:</p>
<p>Rearchitecting the slack and gitter bridges to optionally support 'puppeting users'.  This is in some ways the ultimate flavour of bridging - where you authenticate with the remote service using your "real" gitter/slack/... credentials, and then the bridge has access to synchronise your full spectrum of data with Matrix.  This is in contrast to the current implementations where the bridge creates virtual users (e.g. Slack webhook bots or IRC virtual user bots) or uses a predefined bot (e.g. matrixbridge on gitter) to link the rooms.</p>
<p>This has some huge advantages: e.g. ability to bridge Slack and Gitter DMs through properly to Matrix; bridging presence and typing notifications correctly, not requiring any custom bots or integrations to be configured; not proxying via a crappy bridge bot as per gitter today; letting Matrixed users be completely indistinguishable from their native selves on the remote platform - so supporting tab complete in Slack, profiles, presence, etc.  The main disadvantage is that you have to have an account on the platform already (although you could argue this is a feature, especially from the remote network's perspective!) and that you are delegating access to that account through to the bridge, so you'd better trust it.  However, you can always run your own bridge if trust is an issue.</p>
<p>The work on this is mid-progress currently, but we're really looking forward to seeing the official Slack, Gitter and other bridges support this mode of operation in the new year!</p>
<p>We've also been spending some time working with bridges written by the wider community (e.g. Half-Shot's <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-twitter">twitter bridge</a>) to get them deployed on the matrix.org homeserver itself, to help folks who can't run their own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there's been a lot of work going into supporting the IRC bridge. Main highlights there are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The release of <a href="/blog/2016/12/19/matrix-appservice-irc-0-7-0-is-out/">matrix-appservice-irc 0.7</a>, with all sorts of major new features</li>
 	<li>Turning on bi-directional membership list syncing at last for all networks other than Freenode!  In theory, at least, you should finally see the same list of room members in both IRC and Matrix!!</li>
 	<li>Handling IRC PM botspam from Freenode and OFTC, which bridge through as invite spam into Matrix.  Sorry if you've been bitten by this.  We've worked around it for now by setting appropriate umodes on the IRC bots, and by implementing a 'bulk reject' button on Riot (under in Settings).  This caused a few nasty outages on Freenode and OFTC. On the plus side, at least it shows that Riot scales up to receiving 2000+ invites without exhibiting ill effects...</li>
 	<li>Considering how to improve history visibility on IRC to avoid scenarios where channel history is shared between users in the same room (even if their IRC bot has temporarily disconnected).  This was a major problem during the Freenode/OFTC outages mentioned earlier.</li>
</ul>
Last but not least, we've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrix">gomatrix - a new official Matrix client SDK for golang</a>!  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-neb</a> (the reference golang Matrix bot framework) has been entirely refactored to use gomatrix, which should keep it honest as a 1st class Matrix client SDK for those in the Golang community.  We highly recommend all Golang nuts to go <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/matrix-org/gomatrix">read the documentation</a> and give it a spin!
<h3 id="riot-desktop">Riot Desktop</h3>
<p>Riot development has been largely preoccupied with E2E debugging in the respective Matrix Client SDKs, but <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-riot-0-9-and-desktop-riot-3585d1027243">0.9.3 was released last week adding in Electron-based desktop app support</a>.  (Remember, if you hate Electron-style desktop apps which provide a desktop app by embedded a webbrowser, you can always use another Matrix client!).  If you've been missing having Riot as a proper desktop app, go get involved!</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1874" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-26-at-01.00.12-1024x687.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-12-26-at-01-00-12" width="1024" height="687" />
<h3 id="next-generation-homeservers">Next Generation Homeservers</h3>
<h4 id="ruma">Ruma</h4>
<p><a href="https://ruma.dev/">Ruma</a> is a project led by Jimmy Cuadra to build a Matrix homeserver in Rust - the project has been ploughing steadily onwards through 2016 with a bit of an acceleration during December.  You can follow progress at the excellent <a href="https://ruma.dev/news/">This Week in Ruma</a> blog, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pulse/monthly">watching the project on Github</a>, and tracking the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/blob/master/STATUS.md">API status dashboard</a>.  Some of the latest PRs are looking very promising in terms of getting the core remaining CS APIs working, e.g:</p>
<ul class="simple-conversation-list varied-states">
 	<li><span class="num">Merged #113</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/113">Add implementation for the filter endpoint.</a> 4 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="state state-merged">Merged</span>
<span class="num">#125</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/125">Adding a Server header to API responses</a> 5 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="state state-merged">Merged</span>
<span class="num">#105</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/105">Add basic implementation for the tags endpoint.</a> 5 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="num">Open #106</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/106">Add basic implementation for the sync endpoint.</a> 2 days ago</li>

<span class="num">#58</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/issues/58">API: GET /events</a> 20 days ago</li>
</ul>
Needless to say, we've been keeping an eye on Ruma with extreme interest, not least as some of the Matrix core team are rabid Rustaceans too :)  We can't wait to see it exposing a usable CS API in the hopefully not-too-distant future!!
<h4 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, in the core team, we've been doing some fairly serious experimentation on next-generation homeservers.  Synapse is in a relatively stable state currently, and we've implemented most of the horizontal scalability tricks available to us there (e.g. splitting out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/workers.rst">worker processes</a>).  Instead we're starting to hit some fundamental limitations of the architecture: the fact that the whole codebase effectively assumes that it's talking to a single consistent database instance; python's single-threadedness and memory inefficiency; twisted's lack of profiling; being limited to sqlite's featureset; the fact that the schema has grown organically and is difficulty to refactor aggressively; the fact the app papers over SQL problems by caching everything in RAM (resulting in synapse's high RAM requirements); the constant bugs caused by lack of type safety; etc.</p>
<p>We started an experiment in Golang to fix some of this a year ago in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a> - a "<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html">strangler pattern</a>" homeserver skeleton intended to sit in front of a synapse and slowly port endpoints over to Go.  In practice, Dendron ended up just being a rather dubious Matrix-aware loadbalancer, and meanwhile no endpoints got moved into it (other than /login, which then got moved out again due to the extreme confusion of having to maintain implementations in both Dendron &amp; Synapse).  The main reasons for Dendron's failure are a) we had enough on our hands supporting Synapse; b) there were easier scalability improvements (e.g. workers) to be had on Synapse; c) the gradual migration approach looked like it would end up sharing the same storage backend as Synapse anyway, and potentially end up inheriting a bunch of Synapse's woes.</p>
<p>So instead, a month or so ago we started a new project codenamed Dendrite (aka Dendron done right ;D) - this time an entirely fresh standalone Golang codebase for rapid development and iteration on the platonic ideal of a next-generation homeserver (and an excuse to audit and better document &amp; spec some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KVTNIZIig1iyRBzK91L6B7tnsfmon7CIWh-DCFRd6k/edit">murkier</a> bits of Matrix).  The project is still very early and there's no doc or code to be seen yet, but it's looking cautiously optimistic (especially relative to Dendron!).  The project goals are broadly:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>To build a new HS capable of supporting the exponentially increasing load on matrix.org ASAP (which is currently at 600K accounts, 50K rooms, 5 messages/s and growing fast).</li>
 	<li>To architecturally support full horizontal scalability through clustering and sharding from the outset - i.e. no single DBs or DB writer processes.</li>
 	<li>To optimise for Postgres rather than be constrained by SQLite, whilst still aiming for a simple but optimal schema and storage layer.  Optimising for smaller resource footprints (e.g. environments where a Postgres is overkill) will happen later - but the good news is that the architecture will support it (unlike Synapse, which doesn't scale down nicely even with SQLite).</li>
</ol>
It's too early to share more at this stage, but thought we should give some visibility on where things are headed!  Needless to say, Synapse is here for the foreseeable - we think of it as being the Matrix equivalent of the role Apache httpd played for the Web.  It's not enormously efficient, but it's popular and relatively mature, and isn't going away.  Meanwhile, new generations of servers like Ruma and Dendrite will come along for those seeking a sleeker but more experimental beast, much as nginx and lighttpd etc have come along as alternatives to Apache.  Time will tell how the server ecosystem will evolve in the longer term, but it's obviously critical to the success of Matrix to have multiple active independent server implementations, and we look forward to seeing how Synapse, Ruma & Dendrite progress!
<h3 id="2017">2017</h3>
<p>Looking back at where we were at <a href="/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">this time last year</a>, 2016 has been a critical year for Matrix as the ecosystem has matured - rolling out E2E encryption; building out proper bot &amp; bridge infrastructure; stabilising and tuning Synapse to keep up with the exponential traffic growth; seeing the explosion of contributors and new projects; seeing Riot edging closer to becoming a viable mainstream communication app.</p>
<p>2017 is going to be all about scaling Matrix - both the network, the ecosystem, and the project.  Whilst we've hopefully transitioned from being a niche decentralisation initiative to a relatively mainstream FOSS project, our ambition is unashamedly to become a mainstream communication (meta)network usable for the widest possible audience (whilst obviously still supporting our current community of FOSS &amp; privacy advocates!).  With this in mind, stuff on the menu for 2017 includes:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Getting E2E Encryption out of beta asap.</li>
 	<li>Ensuring we can scale beyond Synapse - see Dendrite, above.</li>
 	<li>Getting as many bots and bridges into Matrix as possible, and doing everything we can to support them, host them and help them be as high quality as possible - making the public federated Matrix network as useful and diverse as possible.</li>
 	<li>Supporting Riot's leap to the mainstream, ensuring Matrix has at least one killer app.</li>
 	<li>Adding the final major missing features:
<ul>
 	<li>Customisable User Profiles (this is almost done, actually)</li>
 	<li>Groups (i.e. ability to define groups of users, and perform invites, powerlevels etc per-group as well as per-user)</li>
 	<li>Threading</li>
 	<li>Editable events (and Reactions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Maturing and polishing the spec (we are way overdue a new release)</li>
 	<li>Improving VoIP - especially conferencing.</li>
 	<li>Reputation/Moderation management (i.e. spam/abuse filtering).</li>
 	<li>Much-needed SDK performance work on matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk.</li>
 	<li>...and a few other things which would be premature to mention right now :D</li>
</ul>
This is going to be an incredibly exciting ride (right now, it feels a bit like being on a toboggan which has made its way onto a fairly steep ski slope...) and we can only thank you: the community, for getting the project to this point - whether you're hacking on Matrix, contributing pull requests, filing issues, testing apps, spreading the word, or just simply using it.
<p>See you in 2017, and thanks again for flying Matrix.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the Matrix Team.</li>
