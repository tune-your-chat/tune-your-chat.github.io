summary: Consider factoring out event content into 'blobs' separate from graphs

  There are various scenarios where we might want to share a single event between multiple rooms:
   * If we 'fork' a room in order to change visibility rules (as per Dave's proposal in SPEC-17)
   * If we build a twitter clone where messages get stored in multiple rooms (per-hashtag, per-mention, etc) for ease of indexing/consumption
   * If we want to easily move threads between rooms in a forum-per-room forum scenario

  I wonder if it'd be worth considering going further towards a git-style data model sooner than later where events are stored and referred separately from event graphs, allowing them to be easily factored out between multiple graphs.
