summary: Historical displaynames (and perhaps avatars?) should be displayed

  Currently if a user leaves a room, we no longer have any displayname available for them, as displaynames are currently propagated as presence events.  As a result their entry in the room history becomes their matrix ID.

  Instead, we should look at the room history to determine what the user's displayname was at that point in time.

  I'm unclear on what happens if we're paginating backwards, and pick an arbitrary historical point in time where we don't capture a displayname change events..
