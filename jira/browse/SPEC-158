  The spec currently allows home servers to list ways the it requires a client to authenticate by protocol. This means that it's impossible for a server to require the client completes more than one auth stage if they use the same protocol, eg. oauth2 to both twitter and facebook.

  I think what the home server cares about is the *what* is authenticated (eg. the user's synapse username and password, the user's ownership of an email address or the user's ownership of a twitter account) and *who* it is authenticated with (eg. the home server, a given identity server or Twitter). The protocol the client needs to speak to do that auth is a purely technical concern.
