  If you backpaginate in #gsoc:matrix.org as a registered user you can get back to the very beginning of the room.  However, the room was created with history_visibility of 'joined' which was then changed to 'world-readable' halfway through.  The 'world-readable' visibility should only take effect from the point that it was changed, and not take effect retrospectively(!)  This is a serious privacy breach.

  If you try to reproduce this as a guest, it works correctly however.

    I see no evidence of the room being created with a history_visibility of {{joined}}:

    This is behaving as intended.
