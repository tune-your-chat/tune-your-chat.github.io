  Whenever I close my laptop or switch networks the webclients seem to get wedged and not recover when connectivity is restored.  pre 0.5 I believe they would correctly restore themselves.  This means that you have to manually refresh the browser tabs to get them listening to events again.

  Manu fixed this ages ago; this looks to be a regression introduced in the last few weeks.

  body: Can't reproduce this. Tried nuking the connection on Chrome, waited a couple of minutes, and when the connection came back it was all fine. Logs would be helpful at this point. There should be bleating on [EventStream] or failed GETs to /events.

  body: There was a bug which caused /initialSync to never retry if it failed. This is now fixed.
