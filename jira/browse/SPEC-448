  There's no API for a client to request information from the HS on a document prior to attempting to download it.  While the event may optionally have some information on an included file/image it's odd not to be able to query it from the repository.

  Things I might want to know before attempting a download:
    a) Size in bytes (before asking for a ziggabyte file that I'll discard part way through)
     b) content type
     for images:
          c) width/height
         ? d) what size thumbnails (if any) the server would prefer us to ask for; e.g. a list of cached sizes it has.
