  There are situations where in order to interact with an AS, we want to either allow or deny users the ability to send or read AS-specific events (SPEC-227). We currently have nowhere to do this. Perhaps it should be part of the AS API - to let ASes apply preset power thresholds (including per-event thresholds) to rooms which are created in the namespaces they subscribe to

  body: 'By @matthew:matrix.org: If we did this by giving the AS API a hook to let ASes inject permissions into a room before it''s created, we''d also need a way to do so to let them configure permissions when an already-created room federated onto the HS where the AS lives. This also sounds similar to needing a way for ASes to interact with rooms without technically being joined to them (SPEC-229)...'
