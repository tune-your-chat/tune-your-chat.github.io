summary: Presence activity updates should be temporally quantised and otherwise only sent when strictly necessary

  Currently we have the embarassing situation that whenever Bob does *anything* (e.g. sends a message in a room somewhere), then if I'm tracking Bob's presence I get a presence update saying "Bob's aliiiiiiiiive!".  This information is doubly irrelevant if i'm in the same room as Bob, and I just saw him send a message.

  So, at the least:
   * We should only send activity updates for users whose activity you wouldn't otherwise be able to see
   * We should perhaps rate-limit those updates to be batched to the nearest 10s or so.
