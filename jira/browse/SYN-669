  After updating my personal HS to 0.14, I experience strange behaviour in my clients: Android’s Matrix Console shows me a room with user names as its name, while Vector web shows I’m joined to #matrix:matrix.org, even though I have left it weeks ago.

  Upon “opening” the room, the Android Console is just loading and loading, failing to display any events after minutes; vector-web, on the other hand, shows me recent(ish) events, even though I’m pretty sure I don’t receive everything.

  When I try to leave the room in Vector web, I get the error message “M_UNKNOWN: Room '!cURbafjkfsMDVwdRDQ:matrix.org' does not exist”

  See events past https://vector.im/beta/#/room/!XqBunHwQIXUiqCaoxq:matrix.org/$145936987410rsFHA:polonkai.eu for some discussion about the problem.
