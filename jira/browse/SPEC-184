  When you create a user using {{/register}}, you only need to use the localpart because the server will helpfully fill in its own domain name, and return you in the response the fully-qualified user ID. This avoids clients having to remember or know the canonical name for the server.

  It might be handy to support a {{POST}} URL to {{/directory/alias}} to assist in creating a room alias when you only know the desired localpart, as it avoids the client needing to remember the full domain name which would otherwise be needed when {{PUT}}ing it.
