                <p>Welcome all for the first Synapse release of 2022: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0">Synapse 1.50</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>, Synapse no longer supports Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as of this version. As a result, we have also stopped shipping Debian packages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
<p>As a reminder, please note that Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) reaches its own end of life <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-December/000275.html">on January 20, 2022</a>. Past this date we will stop producing new packages for Ubuntu 21.04.</p>

<h2 id="encrypted-application-services">Encrypted application services</h2>
<p>Application services (sometimes called "appservices"), are privileged processes that can interact with a Matrix homeserver in a way a normal user cannot. This is especially useful for bridges, as it allows them to register and puppet multiple users on the homeserver to replicate activity from other platforms.</p>
<p>One of the main shortcomings of application services currently is that they do not support end-to-end encryption. This means that messages sent through a bridge are never encrypted and always visible by the homeserver.</p>
<p>We've recently started work to tackle this issue in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>. A first part of implementing this MSC (allowing application services to masquerade as specific devices) has landed in this release of Synapse; work is still ongoing towards a full implementation, so watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="improved-reliability-on-device-list-updates">Improved reliability on device list updates</h2>
<p>While working on this release, we identified a long-standing bug that could prevent Synapse from sending device lists update over federation if the server had a high number of active users and/or users with a lot of devices connected to their account.</p>
<p>This bug was introduced back in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Synapse 1.0.0</a>, and meant that the homeserver would miss some device list updates when communicating with other homeservers if the amount of updates to send was too high. In practice, this means users on remote homeservers could see outdated device information for other users (including outdated device verification statuses).</p>
<p>Synapse 1.50 includes a fix to this bug. This should contribute towards making the propagation of device list updates more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release introduces support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, which allows guest users to send arbitrary state events into a room. This will be especially useful to the ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">group VoIP calls</a>, which involves having users send new state events into the room to signal their participation in a call.</p>
<p>We've also stabilised identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys now that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a> have been merged into the Matrix spec.</p>
<p>On the documentation side of things, the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/turn-howto.html">page</a> on setting up and configuring a TURN server has been updated to feature instructions on how to deal with NATs. This is a much welcome addition as configuring TURN is something a lot of Synapse admins struggle with!</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.50.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/itchychips">Donny Johnson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: An issue preventing client logins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11763">#11763</a>) was identified immediately following the release of Synapse 1.50.0. We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.1">Synapse 1.50.1</a> the same day with a fix for this issue.</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.49.0">Synapse 1.49.0</a> is out now!</p>
<h2 id="platform-deprecations">Platform deprecations</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.49.0 is the last version of Synapse to officially support Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6. This follows our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, Synapse 1.49.0 is the last version of Synapse to support Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
<p>On the topic of supported Ubuntu releases, please note that Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) reaches its own end of life <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-December/000275.html">on January 20, 2022</a>. Past this date we will stop producing new packages for Ubuntu 21.04.</p>
<h2 id="improved-documentation">Improved documentation</h2>
<p>Up until now, a lot of very useful information was stored on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/wiki">Synapse repo's wiki</a>, which wasn't well advertised nor well reviewed.</p>
<p>With this release, we have migrated most of this information to Synapse's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest">documentation website</a>, so all the information you need to set up, maintain and troubleshoot a Synapse instance lives at the same place. Included in these new pages are the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/admin_faq.html">server admin FAQ</a> and a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/understanding_synapse_through_grafana_graphs.html">guide to Synapse's Grafana dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/media_repository.html">media repository</a> documentation has also been updated with a lot of details about how Synapse stores media files.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-tokens">Refresh tokens</h2>
<p>When a Matrix client needs to authenticate a request to a homeserver, it uses what is called an access token. Sometimes server administrators might not want a user's access token to live forever (e.g. for security reasons). To address this concern, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918</a> introduces the concept of refresh tokens to Matrix.</p>
<p>Initial support for refresh tokens in Synapse was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.38.0">version 1.38.0</a>. Synapse 1.49.0 finalises and stabilises this implementation, allowing any client that supports this feature to use it as it is currently described in the related MSC.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release introduces the last changes needed to Synapse for basic threading support. It also introduces support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, which allows clients to jump to a specific date in a room's history (expect a sneak peek of this in the next episode of Matrix Live!).</p>
<p>Another interesting point is the addition of a couple of <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html">admin APIs for federation</a>. More specifically, they allow you to visualise all of the other homeservers your Synapse instance has been interacting with, as well as how successful the last attempts at communicating with them have been.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.49.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ma27">Maximilian Bosch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="till-next-year">Till next year</h2>
<p>This is the last release of Synapse of 2021! The Synapse team will take a break for the holidays, pushing the next release of Synapse (1.50.0) to January 11, 2022.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone who has been using Synapse, contributing to it, and/or supporting us for the past year, and we hope to see you again in 2022! 🎆</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Synapse 1.49, due out on December 14th, will be the <strong>last release of Synapse to support Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6</strong> per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.48/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>. Accordingly, we will remove support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at the same date, as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="password-resets-and-identity-servers">Password resets and identity servers</h2>
<p>This release removes the long-deprecated <code>trust_identity_server_for_password_resets</code> configuration option. This option was initially deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a> back in October 2019.</p>
<p>Admins of servers still using this configuration option will need to update their Synapse configuration to send password resets through an SMTP server directly rather than relying on identity servers to send them on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-apis-and-improved-alignment-with-matrix-1-1">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin APIs</a> and improved alignment with Matrix 1.1</h2>
<p>This release also introduces a handful of new admin APIs, allowing administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#controlling-whether-a-user-is-shadow-banned">un-shadow-ban users</a>, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#block-room-api">block a room</a>, and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">run specific background updates</a> (but we'll talk about this last one a bit later on). The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">delete room API</a> has also been updated to be able to run in the background or to block a room pre-emptively, even if the server doesn't know about it yet.</p>
<p>This release also brings Synapse into greater alignment with version 1.1 of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">the Matrix specification</a> by adding support for API paths beginning <code>/_matrix/client/v3</code> and <code>/_matrix/media/v3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="background-updates">Background updates</h2>
<p>When Synapse updates from one version to another, it might need to run large scale updates on its database. In order to avoid blocking startup for too long while waiting for these updates to run, Synapse runs them in the background after starting.</p>
<p>Lately the Synapse team has been doing some work to improve the performance of these background updates. More specifically, this release includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11421">performance fix</a> for a background update introduced in Synapse 1.47.0, as well as a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">new admin API</a> to let admins rerun specific updates.</p>
<p>Future Synapse updates will also include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11306">module capabilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11260">more configuration options</a> for controlling background updates.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes some improved support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to help threading. It also adds support for the stable identifiers from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>, bringing Synapse closer to supporting end-to-end (or end-to-bridge) encryption support for application services.</p>
<p>We also now publish a Docker image, <code>matrixdotorg/synapse:develop</code>, which tracks the development head of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.48.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/binarymaster">Stanislav Motylkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Neeeflix">Neeeflix</a>.</p>

                <p>Today we are releasing Synapse 1.47.1, a security update based on last week's release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">Synapse 1.47.0</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1">release</a> patches one high severity issue affecting Synapse installations 1.47.0 and earlier using the media repository. An attacker could cause these Synapses to download a remote file and store it in a directory outside the media repository.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only affects homeservers using Synapse's built-in media repository, as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider">synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> or <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>.</li>
<li>Attackers cannot control the exact name or destination of the stored file.</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote from the advisory:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ghsa-3hfw-x7gx-437c-cve-2021-41281-path-traversal-when-downloading-remote-media"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c</a> / CVE-2021-41281: Path traversal when downloading remote media.</h3>
<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.</p>
<p>The last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">advisory</a> has full details, including workarounds.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered and fixed by our internal security team.</p>
<p>Please update at your earliest convenience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We anticipate publishing a <strong>security release</strong>, Synapse 1.47.1, on the coming Tuesday, the 23rd of November.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.47.1 will contain a fix for a high severity issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.47.0 features additions to the admin and module APIs, a plethora of fixes for long-standing bugs, and a raft of internal improvements. Server administrators should note that this release removes a deprecated API for deleting a room and deprecates a module callback. Consult the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1470">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-and-module-apis">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs</h2>
<p>Administrators can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11099">search for rooms by their ID or alias</a>. We hope this will be particularly useful for projects like <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin">synapse-admin</a>! We've also exposed an API to allow admins to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11263">control Synapse's background updates</a>.  And while it's not strictly an API change, there's a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11211/files">patch</a> which makes it easier for homeservers to redirect matrix traffic to port 443.</p>
<p>Authors of pluggable modules have some new toys to play with. There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11126">a way to listen for new events</a>; a means to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11204">retrieve room state</a> and the ability to edit a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11147">user's membership of a room</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>We fixed a variety of different bugs in this release, many of which were long-standing. It's good to see them dealt with! Worth mentioning in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10097">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11199">handling</a> of the <code>device_inbox</code> table, which trim redundant data to reduce database bloat.</li>
<li>Fixes related to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11255">restarting</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11262">workers</a>, to ensure a more reliable upgrade process.</li>
<li>Fix being <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11135">unable to join certain v1 rooms</a>, e.g. <code>#NextCloud:matrix.org</code>, whose state contained floating point numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11207">Fix serialisation and duplication errors</a> when sending ephemeral events to application services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, work continues on improving type-checking coverage, both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11205">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11164">Synapse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/264">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/271">Sygnal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sydent-2-5-1">Sydent 2.5.1</h2>
<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, the reference implementation of a Matrix Identity Server. This is a minor release which mainly tidies up error handling to reduce the amount of noise in logs. It should also make it easier for us to diagnose some outstanding bugs which remain to be squashed.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>In the background, we're still working away at implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to facilitate threading. Early tests are promising. We're also exploring <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a> as a means to speed up room joins. Both will be long term projects that should hopefully reap major rewards for the Matrix ecosystem. Lastly, there's support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3228</a> to allow identity servers to provide bespoke invites to spaces. We mentioned this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/02/synapse-1-46-0-released#sydent-250">last time</a> in Sydent release notes; now we've got support for it on the Synapse side.</p>

                <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Once again it's been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/27/room-version-6-client-server-r-0-6-1-and-federation-r-0-1-4-spec-releases">a little while</a> since we've done a spec release (sorry; we're aiming for quarterly releases from here on out), but this time we have some pretty big news: we've got an <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">all-new spec platform</a> and a new versioning scheme. The new spec platform has been needed for a long time to make better sense of what Matrix is, and as part of getting that out the door we reduced the number of "Matrix versions" to just one.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Will Bamberg for building it out for us, anoa for working out the deployment details, and everyone for testing it all. They talk at length about what this specification even is and about the platform itself on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsdMgXug7u8">Matrix Live S6E19</a>. It's the single greatest improvement to the spec we've seen to date.</p>
<p>The new versioning scheme presents the whole specification as a single document, making it easier to check compatibility between implementations and the spec itself. Previously, a grid would have to be drawn to show whether Server-Server r0.1.4 is compatible with Client-Server r0.6.1 - while obvious at release time, the historical context gets lost quite easily. Now, with a single version number, the entire specification is compatible across a single version number: servers implementing Matrix 1.1 will be compatible with clients implementing v1.1, and vice versa. For the specification itself, this means we no longer have to carefully point and update links between the APIs, as they'll instead be versioned together.</p>
<p>Changing the versioning of the specification does have an impact on the Client-Server API in particular, however. You may have noticed that Client-Server APIs are currently versioned at "r0". By removing rX.Y.Z versioning, all of the endpoints suddenly don't have a version to reference. All endpoints across the specification are now versioned individually to allow for breaking changes at the endpoint level. They no longer require the whole specification to be listed as a breaking change: a v1 endpoint can get additions/changes which are backwards compatible, but if we need to change format (for example) then it'll get bumped up to v2, leaving v1 in its last known state.</p>
<p>For the Client-Server API, a slight complication is that v1 and v2 (alpha) are already versions familiar to those that have been around for a while - to avoid confusing those people, existing Client-Server API endpoints will start at v3. New endpoints introduced after v1.1 will start at v1 instead.</p>
<p>It's been well over a year since the last release, which means there's a whole lot of features and changes to cover. Here we'll try to cover the things most clients/servers will have to worry about, but we do still recommend reading through the changelog included below. Overall, 28 MSCs have been merged through this release, but some have had to be excluded in the interest of getting the spec release out there. Many of them are expected to be in the next anticipated release (which should hopefully be next quarter).</p>
<h2 id="clients-there-s-a-lot-of-stuff">Clients: There's a lot of stuff</h2>
<p>In Matrix 1.1, client developers get all sorts of new features to play with. Clients which support end-to-end encryption should explore <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#server-side-key-backups">key backups</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#secrets">SSSS</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#key-verification-framework">breaking changes to verification</a></strong>. Quite a lot of this stuff has existed for a while, but has made it into the specification formally now. As an added bonus, the emoji for SAS verification <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/master/data-definitions">have been translated</a> (<a href="https://translate.element.io/projects/matrix-doc/sas-emoji-v1/">contribute here</a>).</p>
<p>Knocking has also landed in the spec (thanks Sorunome for leading the charge on this!), opening up the ability for rooms to optionally allow people to request invites to join. This can be helpful for semi-private rooms where it can be easier to approve/deny requests compared to finding someone's MXID and manually inviting them. This does require a <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/rooms/v7/">v7 room</a> to work, however.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Sorunome, <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#spoiler-messages">Message Spoilers</a> have been officially included in Matrix. People can now safely discuss the ending to the latest movie without being banned for spoilers. Though, as a new feature, there's a chance that the spoiler text still gets included in the message: clients should update as soon as possible to avoid their users accidentally getting banned for spoiling the conclusion to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces saga</a> ;)</p>
<p>There's a few other smaller improvements/additions, and of course the regular "various clarifications and bug fixes" to take a look at. For a sample checklist, check out <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/16876">element-web's issue</a> on the subject.</p>
<h2 id="servers-knock-knock-it-s-a-new-room-version">Servers: Knock knock, it's a new room version</h2>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/rooms/v7/">Room version 7</a> has landed, bringing forth the ability for users to knock on rooms (requesting an invite to join). The changes are largely scoped to using the reserved keywords for join rules and membership, and are described through the auth rules. Thankfully, the changes over v6 are minimally invasive so should be quick to implement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/server-server-api/#end-to-end-encryption">cross-signing bits</a> have been included in the API responses and EDU definitions. <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/06/cross-signing-and-end-to-end-encryption-by-default-is-here">Matthew's blog post</a> from last year (it really has been that long...) describes cross-signing and the history of its implementation.</p>
<p>As per usual, there's also various specification errors corrected to aid understanding. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11079">Synapse has an exhaustive issue</a> to detail what servers might need to do.</p>
<p><em>PS: Room versions 8 and 9 are also out there, but will be included in a future spec release.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>We haven't mentioned identity servers, bridges, etc in this post but they have changes too! Below is the whole changelog, the entire year and a bit of it. Thank you to everyone who has submitted MSCs, and congratulations on getting them released. If we forgot yours, please mention it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> so we can apologize and correct.</p>
<p>PS: The MSC process is how changes to Matrix are made, and you (yes, you) can propose those changes too. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew talks about how this process works, and how we avoid blocking clients from implementing their proposals behind the relatively slow spec release cycles.</p>

                <p>Synapse 1.46.0 is out now and includes support for Ubuntu 21.10: Impish Indri.</p>
<p>This release includes a fix for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> that surfaced in Synapse 1.44.</p>
<h2 id="progress-on-threading">Progress on Threading</h2>
<p>While still disabled by default, we're beginning to land code in Synapse to support threaded discussions in Matrix. In particular, the <code>m.thread</code> event relationship defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> is now implemented behind a configuration flag.</p>
<p>There are still many open questions here, and MSC3440 has not yet been approved to merge into the Matrix spec, but it's a start. Threading is essential to Matrix's continued growth and adoption, and we're excited to provide server-side support to this effort.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>This release is mostly comprised of bug fixes and improvements to static typing. Of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>export-data</code> admin command now works and is tested in CI. This command helps server administrators respond to GDPR Subject Access Requests.</li>
<li>A weeks-long effort to refactor how Synapse validates the <code>auth_events</code> field of incoming PDUs has concluded, resolving a few corner cases which could incorrectly allow events into the room state which should instead be rejected.</li>
<li>Further static type hints have been added to Synapse, improving our precise type coverage to 85% of all lines. Currently, 13% of the Python files in <code>synapse/</code> are skipped during mypy runs. We'd like to cut this in half by the end of the year, as well as increasing overall precise coverage in the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sydent-2-5-0">Sydent 2.5.0</h2>
<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>, the reference implementation of a Matrix Identity Server. In addition to fixing bugs, Sydent 2.5.0 passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Admin API to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-or-modify-account">create or modify accounts</a> now accepts a <code>user_type</code> field, allowing for accounts to be set as belonging to bots or support staff.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html">Password auth providers</a> can now be implemented using the new pluggable extension module APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that URL previews are generated server-side, and thus generally disabled in encrypted rooms to avoid leaking information about message content to your homeserver. You may need to adjust the room's settings to see the new oEmbed previews.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-stuck-messages">Fixing Stuck Messages</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">fixes a race condition</a> which would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<h2 id="improved-privacy-for-per-room-nicknames">Improved Privacy for Per-Room Nicknames</h2>
<p>Matrix allows users to set their display names to be different things in different rooms. For example, you might use an alias in public rooms, but your real name in rooms shared with friends and family.</p>
<p>To make it easy to initiate conversations with people, each homeserver maintains a user directory with the Matrix ID, display name, and avatar of the users it sees. Previously, this directory would be updated with the most recent profile metadata that Synapse had seen for a user, even if it was only changed in a single room.</p>
<p>As of 1.45, Synapse only uses includes the <em>default</em> display name of local users in its user directory, ignoring room-specific nicknames or avatars. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5677">#5677</a>).</p>
<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>
<p>This release includes numerous fixes and improvements to Synapse's internals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've added countless static type annotations to Synapse (and related projects like Sydent), giving us greater confidence in its correctness and reducing maintenance costs. Several modules newly have <em>all</em> of their definitions typed, allowing us to require and enforce complete type coverage for all future edits therein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This release includes meaningful fixes and improvements to our OpenTracing and logging machinery, helping us better catch and eliminate bugs in Synapse. This work ultimately reduced matrix.org's Sentry event volume by an order of magnitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic accessor methods have been removed from Synapse's <code>Config</code> class. Previously, Synapse would interpret references like <code>config.send_federation</code> by attempting to guess a reasonable full path, like <code>config.worker.send_federation</code>. As of Synapse 1.45, the full path must be specified directly. This prevents errors where values could be drawn from unexpected or incorrect sections of the server's configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>We'd like to extend a special thanks to Fizzadar from <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> for improving Synapse's <code>update_synapse_database</code> script (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10954">#10954</a>) to allow schema changes to occur while Synapse is running. This is a great step toward reducing the downtime associated with upgrades.</p>

                <p>Synapse 1.44.0 is out now!</p>
<h2 id="loads-of-bug-fixes">Loads of Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>This release primarily includes fixes for over a dozen long-standing bugs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages containing null bytes are now properly indexed for search.</li>
<li>The Room Search Admin API now allows searching for rooms with non-ascii titles.</li>
<li>URL preview caches, which are meant to be ephemeral, are no longer mirrored from the local media store into other media providers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faster-json-responses">Faster JSON Responses</h2>
<p>We now stay within C code while generating large JSON objects for responses, which should be substantially faster than the previous technique, which fell back to Python for encoding.</p>
<h2 id="new-extension-module-apis">New Extension Module APIs</h2>
<p>Spam checker modules can now use a <code>user_may_create_room_with_invites</code> callback to inspect room creation events which include invitations to users via Matrix or other media (email, etc.).</p>
<p>Additionally, the ModuleApi can now inspect IP and User Agent data, as well as checking whether Rooms and MXIDs are local to the current homeserver.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>We've also been busy refactoring. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prometheus stats now distinguish between cache evictions due to entries expiring, and cache evictions due to the cache being full.</li>
<li>The <code>synapse.handlers</code>, <code>synapse.rest</code>, and <code>synapse.storage.databases.state</code> modules are now fully type annotated and checked by mypy, among others.</li>
<li>The user directory search code was cleaned up in preparation for future fixes.</li>
<li>Another half dozen pull requests were merged with an aim toward clarifying federated event authentication code (and associated logging).</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, this release has seen considerable work toward supporting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</a>, along with an update to match the current state of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-spaces">Preparing for Spaces</h2>
<p>Quite a lot of work has gone into preparing for Spaces to graduate from beta testing. For example, Synapse now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asks clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10772">#10772</a>), via the API defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Allows the Spaces Summary APIs to be handled by worker processes.</li>
<li>Omits rooms with unknown room versions from the Spaces Summary.</li>
<li>Properly handles upgrades of Spaces to different room versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes initial work toward fully supporting oEmbed for embedding URL previews (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10714">#10714</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10759">#10759</a>).</li>
<li>Slightly speeds up room joins over federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10754">#10754</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10755">#10755</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10756">#10756</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10780">#10780</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10784">#10784</a>).</li>
<li>Somewhat improves service restart times for large Synapse deployments.</li>
<li>Significantly refactors federation event authentication code for greater clarity (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10744">#10744</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10745">#10745</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10746">#10746</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10771">#10771</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10773">#10773</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10781">#10781</a>).</li>
<li>Adds further static type hints to various modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also spent quite a lot of time on SyTest, our integration test suite. In particular, many of the tests made assumptions about event processing which were not correct when targeting a multi-worker Synapse deployment. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.43.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
