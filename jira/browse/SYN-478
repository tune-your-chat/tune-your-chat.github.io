  When matrix.org's VM fell over the other day, lots of people asked what backup server we can connect to. In practice I think they just want an alternative public server they can create an account on and use - obviously we don't have decentralised accounts or HA between synapses yet. We advertise oddvar.org on the wiki page, but I'm not sure it's being maintained - we could perhaps have an official backup.matrix.org HS or something for this purpose

    oddvar.org is being maintained, but not as an official matrix.org alternative (and AFAIK it's only advertised on the https://matrix.org/blog/project/matrix-console-web/ page). 

    The original intention was to have a list of known clients/servers which could then turn into a "recommended servers" list given that not everyone will/can run their own server. However this is separate to having a "matrix.org" grade alternative server that we commit to maintaining as well as matrix.org
