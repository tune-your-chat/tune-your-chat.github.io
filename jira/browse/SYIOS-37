  MXStore does not and should not store presence events in the MXStore as they are volatile information: they are valid at a giving time and may be invalid at the time the SDK starts.

  When the SDK starts, after loading data from the MXStore, it should make a request to the server to get the up-to-date presence of all the user's friends.
  But the only API to get this information is the global initialSync which was the request we tried to avoid in order to allow a quick start.
