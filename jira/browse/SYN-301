  Steps to reproduce:

  1) Create a new account on http://homeserver.reclaim.technology:8008
  2) Log into account on http://homeserver.reclaim.technology:8008
  3) Join a public room by clicking on it on the displayed list
  4) Once in room, type: /join #matrix:matrix.org

  Expected behavior: state placing user in #matrix:matrix.org and showing user relevant info
  Actual behavior: Room name is not populated and the room ID is displayed instead

  JS console output after /join #matrix-dev:matrix.org:

  "Unknown error: {"data":{"error":"Joining #code:matrix.org"}}" dialog-service.js:97
  .showError() dialog-service.js:97

  "joinRoom: Joined room !pQcaFHTRybSgwLISeL:matrix.org" event-handler-service.js:683
  "Viewing => !pQcaFHTRybSgwLISeL:matrix.org"

  Note, if you then log in using the same account on matrix.org, the room name still shows as the room ID instead. Has not resolved overnight.

    This is probably caused since we incrementally persist state for new rooms rather than persisting it all atomically. If a client then gets given these events it will probably trigger the client to fetch the current state (which will be a partial view since not all state would have been retrieved at that point).

    This is a theory and needs to be confirmed.
