    Using numeric suffixes (e.g. Matthew (1), Matthew (2)) is not relevant. On which criteria this index may be based to be constant in time?

    ----
    I'm not really enthusiastic about the Android implementation:
    "The index is the position in the sorted matrix ids list : this list contains the matrix ID of each member which has the same display name.
    Thus, the index should be constant until a new member has the same displayname."
    In a group with 3 Matthew, the client will display Matthew(1), Matthew(2) and Matthew(3) according to alphabetic order of their userid
    The pb of this implementation is how to handle a new member with the same displayname whose userid is inserted before  Matthew(2) in the sorted userid tab.
    With the current imple, the new member is named Matthew(2); Matthew (2) becomes Matthew(3); Matthew(3) becomes Matthew(4) in chat history since the join of the last Matthew.
    We discuss here, and did not find a solution to fix correctly this issue on client side. Only the server may disambiguate user names in group chat.
