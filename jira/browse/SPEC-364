summary: Invite handling is broken when the inviter leaves the room

  Consider:

  * alice@venus creates a room and invites bob@mars
  * bob@mars joins and invites charlie@mars
  * bob@mars leaves

  At this point, `mars` no longer takes part in the federation of the room, and `charlie` can neither reject nor accept his invite, nor can he see the history of the room.

  Should federation include servers with invited rather than joined members, or does this leak too much data? Or should we decouple the federation from members as per SPEC-300?
