description: |-
  Synapse was failing to relay room events to event streams that connected *after* the client joined the room at commit a551c5dad7e3643f36654a374f6a0d5700b7ea7f.

  The bug was caused by an internal cache being incorrectly populated when the event stream started, however the internal cache was being correctly updated when the user subsequently joined a room.

  Sytest failed to detect the problem because it doesn't have any tests where the user starts the event stream *after* it has joined the room.
