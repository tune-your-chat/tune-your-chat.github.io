  On OSX 10.10.2 with Xcode 6.3.1 installed, and Python 2.7.6 (barely used), I followed the instructions in README.md:

  $ sudo easy_install pip
  $ sudo pip install virtualenv
  $ virtualenv ~/.virualenvs/synapse
  $ source ~/.virtualenvs/synapse/bin/activate
  $ pip install --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master

  and got an error because libffi was missing. [if I paste the error message into here, Jira gives me a beautiful exception, I guess because of some unicode in there it doesn't understand].

  I installed libffi with brew:
  $ brew install pkg-config libffi

  re-ran the pip command, and it worked fine.

  It may be worth mentioning this in either the "Installing prerequisites on Mac OS X:" section, or the "Troubleshooting" section.

  body: Response via email was that it's OS X python, which is surprising as OS X I think has libffi built in, and it's fine on my machine with neither libffi nor python from homebrew.
