  Installation documentation states to use 

      virtualenv env

  and then later make sure to use the right pip/python version

  virtualenv has a switch to decide on the python version while creating the virtualenv, so the correct python-/pip2 get installed, just use

      virtualenv env -p python2.7

  which would install python2.7 and the appropriate pip in the virtualenv.
