  #matrix:matrix.org is full of lots of lurkers who have joined once and don't look to be coming back anytime soon.  It would be lovely to have a setting on the room to boot them out to stop bloating the membershiplist.

  One way of doing this is to run a bot as a privileged user on the channel to issue kick events to the right people.

  This is a bit kludgy though - it would be nicer if the HS for the highest-power user on a channel could go and automatically issue the appropriate events to clear things up.

  (Unclear how this works with e2e encryption)

    I can't believe this has been open for >2 years - it's becoming a defining UX problem of Matrix.

    After talking to [~erikj] tonight, there are basically two solutions:
     * Use presence data (nowadays persisted, yay!) to run a bot per-channel to clear out idlers from a channel.
     * Use presence data (or access_token usage info) on a HS to let HS admins "clean up" idlers on their server - parting them from public rooms etc, perhaps based on idler policy hints in room state.

    There's concern that fixing up Guest access and other changes might be entangled with the 2nd solution, so i suggest we go for the 1st solution at least as a short-term fix.
