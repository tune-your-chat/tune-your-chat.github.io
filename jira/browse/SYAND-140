summary: Client should be able to push notifications without GCM

  As a user w/o gapps, I'd still like to have push notifications.
  These are received via long polling anyway (as stated by @matthew:matrix.org), but the client gets suspended virtually every app switch (by @alien:matrix.org).
  We probably need some sort of persistence (think persistent notification). Should also look into similar applications like conversations.im.

  body: I believe we may already support this if you disable GCM in the settings? We certainly used a foreground service in the days before we spec'ed implemented push in Matrix.

    Seems like it does not work for me (I am *completely* sure I do not receive notifications until I bring the client to front) and @alien:matrix.org.
    GCM checkbox does not activate if I press on it (activation animation proceeds to unchecked state).

    Which application version do you use ?
    Which device ? Which android version ?
    Do you use your own home server ?

    I tried with version 0.5.1 : it works properly with and without GCM.

    ->"GCM checkbox does not activate if I press on it "
    Means that the server rejects the GCM registration : we used to have an issue with very long matrix Id

    -> Did you check your notification rules ?

    Version: 0.5.2-beta (build #257)
    Device / Android version: OnePlus One (bacon / find7op) / Omni 5.1.1-20150614-find7op (SELinux enforcing)
    Home server is matrix.org.

    > GCM checkbox does not activate if I press on it
    > means server rejects GCM registration
    It might also be caused by lack of gapps (Google Apps).

    > Did you check your notification rules ?
    I believe I have.

    I tested on a nexus 6 with official android 5.1.1 with no issue.

    we already got some issues with cyanogen versions (it worked properly with official rom releases with the same account).

    Your android version seems beeing an unofficial one so it is difficult for us to fix an issue without having the device.

    You could send us a bug report :
    1- when you're trying to enable GCM
    2- When the client doesn't receive message while being in background. 
    We will have a look.

    Could you check with another device with the same account ?

    thank you for your help.

    @M-ylecollen: I suspect the issue is associated with lack of gapps on my device as GCM probably depends on them. Will send BR later if still needed.
    @matthew: Will do a bit later.

    Some tests:
     - bacon / 5.1.1 / no gapps ([fuller specs|https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SYAND-140?focusedCommentId=12211&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12211]): no bg service notification, no notifications if app not on foreground
     - manta / 4.4.2 / gapps: quite the opposite (that is, everything works as it should both with or without GCM activated)

    I have a few more devices with different ROMs and configurations (and smth like 40-50 Asus TF-201s to tinker with ;-)), will do some more testing.

    wldhx,

    this behaviour should be fixed by now (on the develop branch).

    I don't close the issue until you tell us if the issue is fixed on your side (as we don't have the right device).

    Your use case was not properly managed : the events thread was not started if the push identifier was not retrieved.

    Notice that the GCM setting will be disable in your case.

  body: I believe we can close this issue now - I've had no problems on find7op so far (though I haven't had the time to test on other devices) - and reopen should we find it is not fixed in all cases.
