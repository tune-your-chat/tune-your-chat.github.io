  On develop currently we have bodge support for ASes by allowing custom query parameters to be sent on every request per MatrixClient instance. It would be better to have a specific method for sending events as an AS for people who want to use a single instance to send as multiple people. This would probably look like {{sendAppServiceEvent(opts, callback)}} where opts can have {{userId}}, etc - we may also want to consider adding a {{state}} parameter which is just directly passed to the {{request}} module (this is specifically useful in the IRC AS which uses this as the request ID for logging purposes. We should formally support a misc key which we will pass to the {{request}} module for people who are doing stuff like that).
