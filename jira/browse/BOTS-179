  If jira.json doesn't have a url key, NEB asks for one with raw_input. However, the on-screen logs cover the input message, and raw_input blocks the bot from starting, which is not very machine-friendly.

  It should either fail to start (with a proper error message), or the JIRA plugin should automagically disable itself if the URL is not present.
