  Some channels (##chat) prevent you from speaking unless you're registered (unknown flag though, since that channel has +CPcntjf https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml ). Other channels have +r to prevent you from joining unless you're registered. Should the AS automatically register M- nicks with NickServ?

    +r : This mode prevents users who are not identified to NickServ from joining the channel. Users will receive a server notice explaining this if they try to join. /mode #channel +q $~a can be used to prevent unregistered users from speaking in channel while allowing them to join

    So in other words, the client can join but is being quieted with +q. We should be able to detect this.

  body: Matrix users can register with NickServ by creating a 1:1 room with {{@freenode_NickServ:matrix.org}} then saying stuff like {{identify passw0rd}}. It's not SASL and it is being proxyed through the AS, but for registering IRC nicks it is adequate for now.
