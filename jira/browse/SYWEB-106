description: |-
  When the user leaves the current room by pressing the (x) icon in recents list, the room is still displayed with the following message:
  "You have been kicked by xxx (@xxx:matrix.org)" where xxx is the user display name

  Expected behaviour: The current room should be removed from recents and next room should be opened.
