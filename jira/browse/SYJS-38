  So far today on bfa8dd0007f4a9cb4ac3472269018e6afe39e0d0 i've had two separate events which got stuck in state 'sending'.  This means that they were greyed out and stuck at the bottom of the timeline until I refreshed. Meanwhile, the events had actually sent.

  I don't have network logs, but from inspecting the timeline with Kegan, the event is stuck at the bottom of the timeline:

  {code}
  92: MatrixEvent
  _pushActions: Object
  _txnId: "m1450365893080"
  encrypted: false
  event: Object
  content: Object
  body: "Boo_Boo_300.gif"
  info: Object
  h: 300
  mimetype: "image/gif"
  size: 15399
  w: 223
  __proto__: Object
  msgtype: "m.image"
  url: "mxc://matrix.org/uvCZgTzCOtQplDSUSiTVqZTg"
  __proto__: Object
  event_id: "$145036589396048tSACd:matrix.org"
  origin_server_ts: 1450365893202
  room_id: "!zOmsiVucpWbRRDjSwe:matrix.org"
  sender: "@matthew2:matrix.org"
  type: "m.room.message"
  unsigned: Object
  age: 175
  transaction_id: "m1450365893080"
  __proto__: Object
  __proto__: Object
  forwardLooking: true
  sender: RoomMember
  status: "sending"
  target: null
  __proto__: Object
  {code}

  ...but is not listed as in flight in the _txnToEvent data structure.  So it was sent, must have been received by /sync, but the event state was not correctly transitioned from sending to sent.
