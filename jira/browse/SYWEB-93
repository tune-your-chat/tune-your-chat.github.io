  body: I'm seeing this again - despite Alexandre not being online at all, it claims that he's online and has the same last active age as me, having invited him into a new room.  It looks hugely as if Manu's memberlist reordering stuff sometimes leaves the presence info completely wrong.  Meanwhile LadyT claims to be online again, and she definitely isn't.

    Resolving this for now. If this is still an issue, another bug with more information would be great.

    Leo has fixed a lot to do with presence, and I've implemented the necessary fixes on the web client (e.g. room initial sync), so I suspect presence is better now.
