    Can this be sent along with the presence information when a client connects?

    If multiple clients are online for a given user at the same time how would we aggregate the different capabilities for the different clients?

  body: This could/should become part of the per-device presence information, along with "am I a mobiile phone"-like signal to suggest limited typing/screen space.

    The fact we still haven't got a way to negotiate what features are available between a given pair of clients is increasingly unfortunate, especially for VoIP.  I'm not sure that presence solves this, given presence isn't currently per-device, and we may need to announce/query a large set of capabilities for the extensions a given client supports rather than use brute force.

    Philipp Hanke recommended we take a close look at XEP-115, as a way of advertising & negotiating caps with minimal bandwidth by doing it in terms of hashes rather than actual content.
