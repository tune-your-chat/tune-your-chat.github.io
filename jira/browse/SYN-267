description: "The discussion on #matrix-dev:matrix.org:\n\nManu: Is this default behavior \"push you for all non-you events\" defined by a push rule? I cannot see it when I list my push rules\t\nDave:  nope, it's the default if no rules match\t\nMatthew: it's implicit, annoyingly. when dave is back in pushland i hope it will be made explicit\t\nDave:  yeah, I should either mandate it in the spec or add it somewhere in the pushrules return\t\nMatthew:  explicitness ftw. and then it can be disabled too."
