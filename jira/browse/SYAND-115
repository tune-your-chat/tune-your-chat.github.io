  Two users:
  - User A
  - User b

  Own Homeserver.

  When user A send pictures, user B is not able to see those in a room "hosted" in the local HS (and vice versa).

  In the webclient the users are seeing those pictures.
  So it is possbile an issue in the Android app.

  Remark:
  As there is still an issue with the certs, the HS is running in HTTP mode (not HTTPS).

    I tried with Matthew's homeserver (http://arasphere.net).

    user A was on matrix.org HS
    user B was on arasphere.net HS.

    A and B exchanged images without any problem.
    Could you start a chat with an account in your homeserver and myself ?

    I suspect that something is wrong in your homeserver but i believe it is better that i chek on the android client.

    It seems to be a problem only on my Nexis 7 (with CM).

    On a third device (Z3 Compact, 5.1) I get the images. On the Nexus 7 I never get images sent by others...
