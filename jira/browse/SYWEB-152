  This issue serves as a working place for all the things that should be done to make {{room-controller.js}} less beastly. Currently, this file is doing way too much, and it is difficult to unit test as a result.

  There are several bits of logic which should be shifted out of this controller, including:
   - -IRC command logic (e.g. parsing text to see if it's a /kick, then invoking {{matrixService.kick}})-
   - -Maintenance of the member list in a room (this is done for us now via {{modelService}}, we should be using that.-
   - Room join logic (incl requesting state events, etc)
   - -Up arrow history (this should really be a directive since it's fiddling with the {{mainInput}}. The directive should contain the messages it can cycle through in its own {{$scope}}.)-

  These can then be tested in isolation, along with the actual room-controller.

  body: Just "Room join logic (incl requesting state events, etc)" remains on this, which will be done by the event-handler-service.
