<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called "The Possibilities". The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>

<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver.

<blockquote>
<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) ‚Äî if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...

</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>

<p>Half-Shot reports very late, to the great despair of TWIM's editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="hookshot-gets-provisioning">Hookshot gets provisioning!</h3>
<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<blockquote>
<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns "unknown room" when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in "bundles" which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>

<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline "upload", etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

                <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bridging edits, deletions, reactions, formatting and read receipts in both directions (even <code>/rainbow</code> somewhat works from Matrix)</li>
<li>Bridging typing notifications and any types of files from Matrix to Google Chat</li>

</ul>
<p>(edits and deletions are only available on Google Workspace accounts, not normal accounts. I have no idea why they did that, but that's just how Google Chat works ü§∑)</p>
<p>There's still a bug where it sometimes silently stops receiving messages, which I'm currently trying to solve (or work around). After that I'll make a v0.3.0 release. Backfilling history may also happen in the near future</p>

<h3 id="matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver <a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">‚Üó</a></h3>
<p>An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to "push" data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de">kim</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to "push" data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>‚ûñ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>‚ûñ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>‚ûñ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>‚ûï MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>‚ûï one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>‚ûï you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>‚ûï no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>‚ûï multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! üí•</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

<p>A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew &amp; Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>

<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement "best effort" basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them üôà.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>after the Miounne update posted a minute ago here is another one, and it's about time: Time To Matrix (ttm) got v1.4.0 release!</p>
<p>Time To Matrix is a <code>time</code>-like command that will send end of an arbitrary command output and some other info (like exit status) to matrix room.</p>
<p>With new release, following things were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>arch linux AUR package</li>
<li>automatic room alias resolving, so you can use <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ttm:etke.cc">#ttm:etke.cc</a> instead of !XODRhTLplrymaFicdK:etke.cc</li>
<li>help message and human-readable errors</li>
<li>option to change message type (<code>m.text</code> or <code>m.notice</code>)</li>
<li>option to omit plaintext and send only html-formatted message (to get some more space for log)</li>
<li>option to override message type to <code>m.notice</code> if the command exits with non-zero exit code (by default <code>m.text</code> is sent, so you will get <code>m.notice</code> on failure)</li>

<h3 id="version-2-3-0-released">Version 2.3.0 Released!</h3>
<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio. Version 2.3.0 adds support for additional configuration via config files and other methods. Currently, there is only one setting that can be changed, however many existing and future features will be able to be enabled or disabled via this config.</p>
<p>Example usage is shown below:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>random_user
</span><span>     !echo something
</span><span>echo_bot
</span><span>     something
</span><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.load_toml(&quot;config.toml&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)
</span><span>PREFIX = &#39;!&#39;

</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>     match = botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX)
</span><span>
</span><span>     if match.is_not_from_this_bot() and match.prefix() and match.command(&quot;echo&quot;):
</span><span>          await bot.api.send_text_message(room.room_id,
</span><span>                                &quot; &quot;.join(arg for arg in match.args()))
</span><span>
</span><span>bot.run()

<li>Performance improvements for protections that need to lock back in the history of a room, decreasing the number of cases in which we could end up timing out.</li>
<li>Many improvements to testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.</p>

<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to "do it right" at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>

<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releases in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.6.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Make reconnect loop more robust</li>
<li>Sensitive flag for MSG and NICKSERV to hide it from network room (for AUTOCMD)</li>
<li>Improved STATUS for admin room and simple STATUS for network rooms</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much going on this week. Hopefully the reconnect refactor doesn't cause any breakage as it fixed multiple issues that have been around since the inception of Heisenbridge.</p>
<p>Vacuum your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ‚ô•üêõ‚ô•</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>
<p>That's all and have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, "hard" kick.</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the "modern" API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‚Äògatekeeping‚Äô platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element‚Äôs mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability.</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an addendum about Sydent. We can see the results of our efforts visually, thanks to mypy's reporting options. Two different metrics show increasing coverage since our typing efforts began in the summer. The grey strip shows the last fortnight's sprint in particular.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the shortfalls facing XMPP users of the Bifr√∂st Matrix bridge is the lack of support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (MAM)</a>, which allows XMPP users to retrieve messages sent when they are offline, when they come online next time. Sunday Nkwuda and Olatunji Ajayi, with help from Pirate Praveen, are planning on writing support for MAM in XMPP.js (the XMPP library that Bifrost uses), and then adding MAM support to Bifr√∂st. Since this requires some dedicated full-time effort, they are fundraising to support this project at https://opencollective.com/mam-plugin-for-xmppjs. Many thanks to the XMPP Standards Foundation for serving as fiscal host for the fundraising.</p>

<p>A smaller release this time around which consists mostly of QoL stuff to make things a little easier. <a href="https://idlerpg.lolhosting.net/">IdleRPG</a> users can now rejoice and login to your character automatically with channel AUTOCMD when joining on reconnect as what's more important: running a bridge to engage in deep conversations or sit in a channel doing nothing?</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks a lot not-anoa, that was a great spec update!</p>

<h3 id="slack-bridge-1-9-0-rc1-with-a-psa">Slack bridge 1.9.0-rc1, with a PSA</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am a bit busy at the moment, Nheko is getting a lot of valuable smaller contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the emoji pickers to Unicode 14, so that you can properly troll people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past üôÇ).</p>

<p>Hydrogen embedded! I'm looking forward to that. Great work Bruno!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>
<p>The full changelog is available on the repo: https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot/releases/tag/v2.0.0</p>

<h3 id="newgrounds-mvs-matrix-advancement-server">Newgrounds MVS (Matrix adVancement Server)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mr_johnson22:matrix.org">mr_johnson22</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>

<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to "act" based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices.</p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p>Hi there,
Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while. If somebody not familiar - we setup and maintain matrix servers (based on awesome <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>)... and setup VPN... and DNS recursive resolver, and... AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in "well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard..." way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown</p>

<p>That's very considerate for IRC user, thanks hifi!</p>

<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko got a lot more colorful this week. red_sky (nheko.im) and LorenDB finished up the jdenticon support. This means instead of the first character of a users display name, you now have the option to see a colorful avatar for users without an explicit avatar. You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to visit us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and tell me, that I am wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming "follow other user" feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

<h3 id="aagrinder">AAGRINDER</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@maze:mazie.rocks">Maze</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@s7evink The game is called AAGRINDER, hosted at <a href="https://aagrinder.xyz">aagrinder.xyz</a>, the code is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder">here</a>, the bridge implementation is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder/-/blob/main/server/matrixappservice.js">here</a>, wiki is <a href="https://wiki.aagrinder.xyz/index.php?title=Main_Page">here</a>. The game is a text-based sandbox multiplayer browser game that I (Maze) have been building for the past 3 years. Built from nothing, no game engine. It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're able to extract some useful information out of this ^^</p>

<p>I love the retro vibe of the game, it's really cool!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arobertlong:matrix.org">Robert Long</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third Room is an experimental metaverse client I've been working on for the past couple weeks. It combines three.js and Matrix to create 3D voice chat rooms where you embody an avatar.</p>
<p>There's a lot more info in my talk from last night at the Open Metaverse Interoperability Demo Night (my talk starts at 37:43)</p>

<p>Beeper mentioned they have several positions open, and <a href="https://element.io/careers">Element is also talents hungry</a>. I‚Äôm particularly ecstatic to see that developing skills around Matrix can get people jobs. Of course I encourage strongly people to experiment with the protocol and use it in all sorts of crazy ways!</p>
