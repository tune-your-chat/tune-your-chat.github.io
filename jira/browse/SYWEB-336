  In almost all modern web & mobile chat clients there is support for emoji icons, thus Matrix should have this too :)

  I suggest implementing the method which supports :smile: and :) style emoji detection / creation!

We could do something to let users on other platforms use them too though.'

    Hey David, slightly confused by your comment- I know you don't have :smile: style notation. Are you saying the API can't support it or you don't plan to implement it or just that you have not implemented it yet?

    I filed the issue as it's something on my personal use case / radar as something I think Matrix should have. I'm filing issues for these sort of features that I am not actually working on at the moment. Should I not be doing so?

    Oh no, please keep filing thing like this: I was just adding the information that this is all technically feasible and that we support proper UTF-8 emoji characters right now - we just don't have an interface built into the app to translate :smile: into a UTF-8 smile (as I think in any case we'd want to send the emoji over as a UTF-8 emoji rather than sending ':smile:' over the wire).

    In an ideal world, everybody's OSes / browsers would let them enter emoji natively, but in practice not all platforms are there yet so it would probably a good idea to add client-side support of :smile: syntax as you say, although we could also do this by adding an emoji-picker or something.
