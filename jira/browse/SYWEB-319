  The ability to scroll up and have the older messages lazily load is really cool! A small but very useful enhancement would be to show loading feedback while itâ€™s processing. Just a small loading spinner would suffice.

  Feel free to use the spinner we use in ownCloud: https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/core/img/loading.gif (very simple and quite widely used)
