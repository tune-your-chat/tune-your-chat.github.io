  There a few different kinds of IDs in the Matrix specification. In some cases the user has the user has the ability to choose what an ID will be for a given event or record, but sometimes they are generated by the server. In either case, the specification should be explicit about any formatting and uniqueness restrictions on IDs. Even if these values have no constraints and are dependent on the server implementation, this should be stated explicitly. For example, it's stated that a user ID local part must be generated by the server if not supplied by the user during the registration process, but there's no information about how this value would be generated and what its constraints are.

  All the types of IDs I can think of:

  * Call ID
  * Event ID
  * Filter ID
  * Media ID
  * Room ID
  * Session ID
  * Transaction ID
  * User ID

  body: In Synapse, when a user ID is generated by the server, it consists of a string beginning with "-" followed by 18 random ASCII letters. There's also a check to ensure user ID local parts supplied in the registration request don't contain characters that need to be URL encoded. It's not clear which of these constraints, if any, are required by the spec and which are just implementation details of Synapse.

  body: I think these are now covered by the children of SPEC-1, so I'm going to close this.
