    The messages are sortered by the serverTs timestamp. So, it is based on the server time.
    On blah, as far i remember, it was based on the message timestamp i.e. the sender set the timestamp. They were no such issue.

    Do you expect that the unsent / pending messages stuck the following messages sending ?
    What about media upload stuck ? Should they suspend remaining messages sending ?

    for example,
    1 - sending "Hello"
    2 - sending "the world"

    Do you expect that "the world" is not sent if
    1 - "Hello" was sending  ?
    2 - "Hello" sending is cancelled  after 3 retries ?
