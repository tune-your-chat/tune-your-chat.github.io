  With a slow internet connection (or large images):

  In a room:
  Click on an image message to full-screen-view it.
  Dismiss it.
  Click on another image message to full-screen-view it.

  Notice that the old image is full-screen'd until the new one loads.

  You can simulate this really clearly if in synapse/rest/media/v1/base_resource.py you add a time.sleep(3) in _download_remote_file on the serving path
