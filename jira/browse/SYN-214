summary: Should we encourage client-side thumbnailing after all for low-latency file transfer?

  With the new media repo, we've shifted to a model where the server is expected to thumbnail all content (we've even talked about the thumbnail_url parameter being obsoleted).

  However, this has two big disadvantages:
   * Thumbnailing huge images (especially when all the different clients in a room ask for the various resolutions they need simultaneously) can be a resource load on the server
   * We can't quickly send a small thumbnail through in advance of the main image content.  Thus image sending becomes slooow (like hangouts), in that the whole image has to go from origin client->origin HS->dest HS before you can see a thumbnail of it on the dest client.  This is a major step backwards from Amdocs UC.

  So... perhaps we need to support both approaches after all.  Server-side thumbnailing is available as a fallback for simple clients (e.g. web browsers who don't want to mess around with Canvas for client-side thumbnailing).  But we still support client-side thumbnails as an option.

  This begs the question: what resolution(s) do we thumbnail when doing so clientside?  Perhaps we just mandate a resolution for default thumbnails, and this is then used to prepopulate the server-side cache (if available).

  Does the wire protocol let us send the event describing an image before the main content has been uploaded?  Otherwise sending thumbnails in advance is going to be hard...
