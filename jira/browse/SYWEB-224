  <Amandine> surely if i login as @Amandine:matrix.org it should recognize i'm logging into matrix.org

  If users log in with an mxid, why are we bothering prompting confusingly for homeserver URL at all?  We should discover it from the domain in their matrix ID.  Might need a better mechanism (e.g. well-known URIs) for mapping from homeserver domains to actual C-S API URLs.
