summary: When you're kicked from a room, it shouldn't disappear from recents

  Unless you leave a room yourself, i don't think rooms should disappear from your recents when you are kicked (including after refreshing).  This is so that if a anti-zombie bot kicks you off, you can see that you got kicked when you next log in.

  (This may already be the case - sorry if so)
