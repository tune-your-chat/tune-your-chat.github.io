summary: Show error when using HTTP home server url from HTTPS

  Currently, if a user sets the home server url on the login form to be HTTP when the webclient is loaded over HTTPS, chrome will silently fail to login.

  This particularly affects users with lastpass, which also stores the home server url. (We don't necessarily want to discourage lastpass from storing the url, since that is the correct behaviour)
