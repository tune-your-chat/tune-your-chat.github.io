  Rescued from https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/23:

  Is there any way to configure the cache behaviour? We don't seem to track the age of remote content - it's surely important to let people specify how to reap content; whether it's by expiring old content or limiting the total size of the cache in bytes.

  Is there a way to tell the HS to proactively suck in content for a room? Given HS messages are proactively pushed throughout the mesh of participating servers, it seems that it could be nice to (optionally) have my HS pre-cache the attachments too to avoid the origin having disappeared by the time i get round to viewing them - assuming disk space isn't a problem.
