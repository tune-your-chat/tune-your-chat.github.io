    It's actually a bit different - iOS already tries to have the 'right' functionality of reusing existing chats.  It just gets it wrong in this particular UI flow.

    Separately, we do want to support having multiple 1:1 chats with the same user if you really want to - but agreed this should not remotely be the default behaviour.

    What would be the use case though?

    a) Separating conversation threads.  For instance, I might want to entirely separate my social and professional conversations with someone on my team at work.
    b) Supporting bridging to other chat ecosystems which already have this semantics - e.g. in Lync, you can open multiple conversations with the same person for different topics.  To bridge to Lync, we need to support the same.

    Agreed we should not be doing it by default though.
