<p>The Matrix Foundation is a candidate this year again to the GSoC programme. If you intend to mentor a student around your Matrix project, please ping me (@thib:ergaster.org) in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> room. Your project doesn't have to be set in stone yet: we need to have a good estimate of the number of mentors and projects applying before FOSDEM (by the end of next week).</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week and the week afterwards, the Spec Core Team are mostly focused on improvements to Matrix that we'd like to show off at FOSDEM 2023 this year! That consists of MSCs related to Faster Room Joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3943">MSC3943</a> among others) and Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>).</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230">MSC3230: Spaces top level order</a>!</p>
<p>This defines an algorithm and a data structure that can be used to order one's top-level list of Spaces and have that order sync across all of their clients. Rooms and spaces within a Space continue to have their order <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#ordering-of-children-within-a-space">defined</a> by an <code>order</code> key (and failing that, the <code>origin_server_ts</code> field) in the corresponding <code>m.space.child</code> event of their parent's Space's state.</p>
<p>I won't get into the details of the algorithm here (or its criticisms), but feel free to jump into the MSC and take a look!</p>

<p>Back in July I started a discussion on wikidata for adding a matrix space property, after much discussion in the wikidata community (lead mostly by tgr) we instead landed on a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P11478">Matrix room property</a>. This now enables slightly more accurate semantics when describing matrix rooms belonging to organizations, projects, and people on wikidata.</p>
<p>Wikidata is a knowledge base available under a free license and using standard machine-parsable data to add information to what is known as the "semantic web", this allows querying for information like for example: <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/#%23%20Organizations%20with%20matrix%20rooms%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Forg%20%3ForgLabel%20%3Froom%20%3FtypeLabel%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Forg%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ43229.%20%23%20Find%20items%20which%20are%20some%20kind%20of%20organization%0A%20%20%3Forg%20p%3AP11478%20%3Fs.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20Which%20have%20some%20statement%20%3Fs%20about%20having%20a%20matrix%20room%0A%20%20%3Fs%20ps%3AP11478%20%3Froom.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20the%20statements%27s%20matrix%20room%20value%20is%20%3Froom%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20And%20which%20optionally%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fs%20pq%3AP31%20%3Ftype.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20is%20of%20type%20%3Ftype%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%20%23%20Helps%20get%20the%20label%20in%20your%20language%2C%20if%20not%2C%20then%20en%20language%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20%3ForgLabel">Organizations with matrix rooms</a></p>

<p>As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.</p>
<p>This week has also seen <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a> become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: "Owned" State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can "own" certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user "owns" a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>

<p>As we send off 2022 with a bang, it makes sense to look back on what we did this year and where we want to go next year. In its holiday special post, the Matrix Foundation has been focusing on the core team's work. This post is focusing on the achievements of the community outside of the Matrix Foundation.</p>
<p>I tried to reach out to as many people I have seen do "stuff" on Matrix and have them write something they would see fitting for a year in review. Now, most people have better things to do between christmas and new years, so I hope you can excuse if some projects are missing. Also I probably forgot like half of the interesting people... HOWEVER! I hope you still enjoy what everyone wrote up.

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3917">MSC3917: Cryptographically Constrained Room Membership</a> is rather interesting. It aims to make room membership in a room cryptographically verifiable via a "Master Signing Key" that's controlled by users. This is in addition to the homeserver signatures typically placed on events in Matrix. The purpose is to prevent a homeserver from being able to lie about your membership in a room. While not the end-all-be-all solution to this particular problem, it's certainly a well-reasoned take.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3032">MSC3032: Thoughts on updating presence</a>!</p>
<p>A loose collection of thoughts on how presence (the ability to see whether people are online/office) may be improved at the Matrix protocol level, and how it could be integrated into a profiles-as-rooms feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1769">MSC1769</a>).

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> explains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soon-to-be working group within the IETF called "More Instant Messaging Interoperability" (MIMI) is aiming to solve, well, messaging interoperability for primarily reasons of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA requires "gatekeepers" to interop with other platforms while maintaining the same level of encryption, and we think Matrix is the perfect fit for this use-case. While we'd likely be saying goodbye to Olm and Megolm in the process, we'd be saying hello to Messaging Layer Security (MLS) and its decentralized counterpart DMLS - a good thing in our books, at the moment.</p>
<p>In terms of what we've done this week in publishing our drafts (and soon to be real Internet-Drafts under the IETF process), we're formally proposing that Matrix's Federation API and event schema be used for messaging interoperability. Our very own Matrix spec process will be impacted by this sort of direction as it makes it (theoretically) "harder" to change details of the spec. To avoid it being extraordinarily difficult, we'll be nailing down some of the edge cases of the Federation API and event format ( üëÄ extensible events) naturally as we work closer and closer to an RFC series. We'll also be making some architectural changes to our specification itself to better support half of it being in the IETF domain, like defining room versions more clearly and splitting non-core spec out of the way. It's worth noting that this is a relatively slow process as we work towards the deadline of DMA a few years from now, but the changes might be felt by the ecosystem on a more rapid scale.</p>
<p>At the moment, we're planning to attend IETF 115 to help keep Matrix on the map for MIMI and raise our feedback about the proposed working group charter. Discussions about whether Matrix is the correct fit are already ongoing, but expected to increase as we get closer to IETF 116 next quarter. We were also already at IETF 114 a few months ago where many of these conversations started.</p>
<p>Future work is currently expected to come through under my name, as have the current drafts (both with obvious input from Matthew as project lead). Watching this space and the spec process for updates is best üôÇ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm working on a little Matrix project called Telodendria.</p>
<p>Telodendria is eventually going to be another homeserver implementation.  It isn't one yet; I'm still in the <em>very</em> early stages of prototyping it, and writing some boilerplate code, but I've been encouraged to throw the project out there for more exposure, so here we are!</p>
<p>Telodendria is written in ANSI C, will use a custom flat-file database, and relies <em>only</em> on a POSIX system to be built and run. It won't pull in any dependencies; as much as possible will be written from scratch, including the HTTP stack, JSON parser, and any other baseline stuff a Matrix homeserver needs.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>One of the goals is simply to build a useful homeserver, but also just to learn about the inner workings of Matrix and the technology that supports it, as well as to have a bit of fun in the process.</p>
<p>At this point we've got Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, Construct, and a few other great projects. So you're probably asking, What <em>practical</em> reasons are there to build another homeserver? The best answer to that is in <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html">Telodendria's manual</a>, but what it really comes down to is being portable and lightweight.  It'd be cool to have a Matrix homeserver server that can run <em>anywhere</em>, but specifically targets the more obscure operating systems like the BSDs. Additionally, it should be light enough to perform well on Raspberry Pis, routers, cheap VPSs, and other low-power and low-storage devices that might not be as capable of running a full database plus a hefty Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p>For me personally, I just want a homeserver that feels like it belongs on OpenBSD and is capable of handling my use case without having to install any third-party packages. I'm a digital minimalist that wants to cut down on his software requirements, and Telodendria is one of the ways I've set out to do that.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-get-involved">Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>There's definitely plenty of code and documentation to be written, so if you're looking for a challenge and believe in the project's philosophy, you're highly encouraged to get involved in whatever way you're able.</p>
<p>The development discussion happens entirely on Matrix. If you're unsure where to start, start by joining the project rooms <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html#DESCRIPTION">listed in the manual</a>. Do be sure to also check out main <a href="https://telodendria.io">project website</a>, which has a list of all the manual pages. The manual should contain much of the information you'll need to get started, but it's far from complete, so if you find the information to be insufficient, don't be afraid to ask questions in the rooms listed above.</p>

<p>Great news! The FUTO organization selected me for a grant to sponsor me working on Conduit. I want to finally work on the big remaining issues like threads, backfilling, spaces and so on. Also keep an eye on the Conduit v0.5 release. It is almost done and contains many bug fixes. You can already try it out by compiling conduit-next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the Synapse team are out at the moment; we have mostly been in maintenance mode, both for the project and the Matrix.org deployment. With that said: we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0">Synapse 1.70.0</a> on Tuesday followed by a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.1">1.70.1</a> patch release today. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>better support for <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#threading">threads</a>,</li>
<li>full support for Matrix <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/changelog/#v13">1.3</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/changelog/#api-changes">1.4</a>, and</li>
<li>small fixes to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/milestone/10">experimental faster joins work</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community of contributors, server operators and users who've been involved in this release. We'll be cutting a release candidate for Synapse 1.71 on the upcoming Tuesday (1st November), aiming to release the week after (8th November).</p>
<p>As for this week: we've been testing Synapse against the recent Python 3.11 release, dealing wit h CI deprecations and working through our backlog of old PRs. Lots of small things to juggle!</p>

<p>I guess the most exciting news is that the macOS M1 builds are now merged to master and will be available for the next release. Seems like those are even faster on macOS that the intel builds! (Time from launch to be able to send a message is about 1 or 2 seconds.) The builds are using the generous cirrus CI open-source offering, so thank you!</p>
<p>Another good news is that a fox fixed the upload widget sometimes breaking Nheko when trying to upload specific files on some platforms. Apart from that there were also minor fixes to room sorting in communities, performance fixes to the parent community links as well as work on enabling more warnings when developing Nheko (to ensure our code is better quality, more secure and less error prone).</p>

<ul>
<li>Renamed the app back to "Circles".  Technically the proper name of the app is "FUTO Circles", but it will show up on your home screen as simply "Circles", similar to how Google Photos is "Photos" and Google Maps is "Maps".  The Circuli name was too hard for most English speakers to pronounce, and it didn't solve our other issues with the name.  "FUTO Circles" should do the trick.</li>
<li>We're keeping the Circuli name for our online service.</li>
<li>Added QR-code-based device verification.</li>
<li>Made registration tokens optional, i.e. it's up to the server whether to require them or not.  Currently we do require registration tokens on our servers, and you can sign up with the token 0000-1111-2222-4444.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Long-awaited and with a bunch of final bug-fixes on the server side, this week eventually saw the merging of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a>, enabling e2ee and to-device message support via sliding-sync on main. With that, and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1154">additional APIs on</a>, a new Element-x with e2ee support was made available. A release that also features the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1138">work on the timeline API</a>, which, too, has seen its fair share of progress this week - mainly internal fixes and debugging helpers.</p>
<p>As a result of the sliding sync work, just earlier today, an important PR was opened for jack-in, the experimental debugging TUI client based on matrix-rust-sdk (which we use for debugging sliding sync): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1156">now allowing you send (encrypted) messages</a>, too.</p>
<p>Following last weeks announcement we also made the Rust-Sec public, indicating why we recommend upgrading to 0.6.1, which we released shortly prior.</p>
<p>Other than that, work has been progressed in the background on the pretty complex problem of async in uniffi and system-specific runners, namely libdispatch on ios rather than tokio, as well as work on uniff proc-macros.</p>

The intention is to give clients a clearer picture of what file formats will receive a proper thumbnail before they are uploaded to the homeserver.</p>
<p>Comments on the MSC seem to suggest that the MSC as it stands does not completely solve the problem: while it does give clients an explicit list of supported mimetypes, the list is quite short. And the list of SHOULD mimetypes cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>The MSC also clarifies that encrypted media should always be uploaded with a mimetype of <code>application/octet-stream</code>, instead of the original media's mimetype, which seems like a welcome and uncontentious point. And finally, it defines <code>501 M_UNSUPPORTED</code> to be returned instead of an internal server error on thumbnailing failure.</p>
<p>I believe the next step for this MSC is for the current threads to be incorporated into the text; so don't miss the threads when reading it!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.69! It comes with improved caching tools for third-party modules, and support for a bunch of experimental features, such as thread-aware read receipts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a>) and an approval flow for new registrations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3866">MSC3866</a>). As part of this release, we've also laid out the removal schedule for the long-deprecated legacy Prometheus metric names, and the <code>generate_short_term_login_token</code> module API method. Read all about it on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released</p>
<p>Another big thing in Synapse 1.69 is experimental support for faster remote room joins! You can read more about it on the blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins but briefly, we are ready for server admins to begin testing, with some caveats. If you've read the post and feel confident, turn it on, give it a spin and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>Alongside 1.69, we're also disclosing a moderate severity vulnerability that we fixed back in Synapse 1.62. If your deployment runs a Synapse version older than 1.62, and is openly federating, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest convenience. More info on this in advisory <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765">GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765</a> and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31152">CVE-2022-31152</a>.</p>
<p>This week we've also released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.70 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0rc1">1.70.0rc1</a>). This release will include experimental support for thread-aware notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>) and filtering (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874">MSC3874</a>), improved validation, advertising support for Matrix 1.3 and 1.4, and the usual load of bugfixes and internal improvements. We're very grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse more stable by testing and running release candidates, and reporting bugs to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">the issue tracker</a> and general feedback to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.4">Dendrite 0.10.4</a> which contains the following features and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tables belonging to the user API will be renamed so that they are namespaced with the <code>userapi_</code> prefix
<ul>
<li>Note that, after upgrading to this version, you should not revert to an older version of Dendrite as the database changes <strong>will not</strong> be reverted automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The backoff and retry behaviour in the federation API has been refactored and improved</li>
<li>Private read receipt support is now advertised in the client <code>/versions</code> endpoint</li>
<li>Private read receipts will now clear notification counts properly</li>
<li>A bug where a false <code>leave</code> membership transition was inserted into the timeline after accepting an invite has been fixed</li>
<li>Some panics caused by concurrent map writes in the key server have been fixed</li>
<li>The sync API now calculates membership transitions from state deltas more accurately</li>
<li>Transaction IDs are now scoped to endpoints, which should fix some bugs where transaction ID reuse could cause nonsensical cached responses from some endpoints</li>
<li>The length of the <code>type</code>, <code>sender</code>, <code>state_key</code> and <code>room_id</code> fields in events are now verified by number of bytes rather than codepoints after a spec clarification, reverting a change made in Dendrite 0.9.6</li>

            <p>As of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released">Synapse 1.69</a>, we consider "faster remote room joins" to be ready for testing by server admins.</p>
<p>There are a number of caveats, which I'll come to, but first: this is an important step in a project which we've been working on for 9 months. Most people who use Matrix will be familiar with the pain of joining a large room over federation: typically you are just faced with a spinner, which is eventually replaced by a cryptic error. If you're lucky, the room eventually pops up in your room list of its own accord. The whole experience is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1211">one of the longest-standing open issues in Synapse</a>.</p>
