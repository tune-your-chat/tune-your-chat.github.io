  Currently the user list on the right is sorted by activity. That’s great in itself, but too many things count as »activity«:
  * looking at the channel
  * typing
  * actually posting a message

  This results in it moving around a lot which is very distracting.

  To alleviate this a bit, only the act of actually posting a message should make one move up the list.
