summary: Using ng-keydown for key-up/key-down is probably a bad idea performancewise

  It's possible to chew 100% CPU currently by holding down a key on autorepeat in the webclient.

  I suspect some of this is caused to having to evaluate the ng-keydown expression for every keypress, as well as the autocomplete directive.  Would be good to turn ng-keydown into a general directive and probably combine it with autocomplete - or possibly even switch to plain old JS to avoid Angular overheads.

    This appears to have been fixed after the initial round of fixes to stop typing delays.

    I cannot reproduce the 100% CPU spinning like I could before. top showed moderate increases in CPU usage (<50%) which is comparable to <textarea>s in other websites e.g. Github. It even passes my "smash fingers on keyboard and see if there is any noticable delay" test.

  body: 'Confirmed: If you remove the ng-keydown on the textarea, performance improves dramatically. Also, fwiw, autocomplete is *not* a directive here.'
