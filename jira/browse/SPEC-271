summary: Messages for E2E to notify about new devices

  When a user adds a new device it should send a message to the other devices that the user owns so that they can cross-sign the public key of the new device.

  This should do some kind of crypto based off of a shared secret, e.g. an N digit code, to authenticate the new device.

  Once the new device's key has been cross-signed by the old device key, then a message should be sent to all devices that the user is chatting with to add the new device to the conversation.

    We now have messages to notify about new devices (although, as with the rest of the stuff we've thrown in for E2E, they are woefully underspecced), so this is done.

    Cross-signing is a *whole* other kettle of fish.
