  Can't find the bug for this so opening one just in case it's never been filed.

  There are many places we've seen where it could be useful for servers to participate in a room's federation even if none of their users are joined to the room:

  * Non-member access to remote servers (peeking at message history) (SYN-715)
  * -Hyperlinking to message IDs (ORG-26)- (This requires a room id anyway)
  * ASes which are subscribed to events from 'remote' rooms
  * Replication of rooms for HA between different homeserver clusters
  * ...and probably many more.
