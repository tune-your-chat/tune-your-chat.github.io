  CAS and SAML aren't really lightweight as sometimes needed. Therefore I'd like to propose another method for third-party authentication using JavaScript Web Tokens. 

  The client authentication with an identity provider with it's own flow. The IS provides a signed JWT that includes user information. Using the token we can login at the homeserver in two different ways. 
  1. The homeserver decrypts the JWT using his private key. If the contained user_id exists in the database, the the homeserver returns an access_token. 
  2. The JWT replaces matrix own access_token flow. Therefore we would not query the DB for the existence of an access_token, but using the information in the JWT. 

  The first approach would break less things, I guess. What do you think?
