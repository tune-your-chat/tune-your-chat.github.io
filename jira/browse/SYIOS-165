  When an account is shared between several devices, joining an empty room is not properly dispatched on the other devices.

  Steps to reproduce
  1 - use the same account on 2 IOS devices
  2 - create a room on another account (with no message)
  3 - Join the room on one of the IOS device

  The joined room is displayed  at the history bottom because there is no more message in the room history.
