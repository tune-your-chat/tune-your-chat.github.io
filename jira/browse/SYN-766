  When requesting a full_state /sync with a filter limiting the number of room timeline events to 50, synapse 0.17.1 may send a response where the first timeline event exactly byte-for-byte duplicates one of the state events. The events I've observed this happening with are membership transitions, likely because those are the most common state events.

  This contradicts the specification's statement that the state represents "all state up to the start of the timeline"

  Two example Joined Room objects from /sync concerning #nix:matrix.org are attached.
