summary: Handling invites from /initialSync is unintuitive

  There are 2 very different ways of recognising invites currently.

  The first is when you are listening on the event stream and someone invites you: you get an {{m.room.member}} event which contains the invite. I like this because it is the same as when other people invite other people, it's all nice and consistent.

  The second way is if you were NOT listening on the event stream and therefore hit {{/initialSync}} at a later time. Then, it comes down as this non-event, with {{membership}} and {{inviter}} keys. This does strictly contain the required information, but why not use the {{state}} array and dump the actual {{m.room.member}} event there?

  As a result of this duality, clients have to have 2 separate ways of handling invites, and the latter is *horrible* since it isn't even coming down as an Event object!!
