  Presumably related to avatars never loading when you call someone.

  Also, we should kill the feedback section entirely in favour of the bootstrap error alerts that Kegan's using elsewhere in the app.

  body: This piece of code isn't looking for existing profiles from the User. Will fix that. I am not however going to change this particular message to be an error dialog, given it is secondary to the intended action (calling someone) and could get rather annoying...

  body: if we're still expecting the feedback div to be used, we need to change where it sits, as currently it's half-off the bottom of the page.  how often is it now being used?

    Currently, {{feedback}} is used for:

    _Ones marked with (X) are ones I propose to move to error dialogs._

    Room page:
     - Successfully inviting someone to a room (X - Success dialog)
     - Failing to upload image/file (X)

    Homepage:
     - Failing to load your own profile info

    Settings:
     - Failing to upload image (X)
     - Failing to load your own profile info

    User page:
     - Failing to create a room with the target user. (X)

  body: Okay, so we need to put it somewhere more sensible (or shrink the font-size so it fits). will just go fix it now.
