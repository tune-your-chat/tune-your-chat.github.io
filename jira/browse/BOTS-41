  Two Matrix users with the same display name e.g. "Matthew" can cause local echos by doing the following:
   - First Matrix user says something
   - Second Matrix user says something
   - First Matrix user says something again (this will echo)

  For whatever reason, the virtual IRC user check is failing in this scenario.

    So it turns out that the server pool which maintains a map of domain+nick to {{VirtualIrcUser}} was being clobbered incorrectly by fixing BOTS-29 (the race condition one). It would clobber it with a nick which was not yet verified as being free on the IRC server. As a result of the clobber, the bridge effectively forgot it was maintaining the clobbered virtual IRC user.

    Fix for this will be to stage connections in the pool until they can be verified, using them only if there is no verified (connected) match.
