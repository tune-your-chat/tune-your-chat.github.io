  On the settings page, we have a thumbnail of the user's avatar. If they hit the avatar, the Gallery opens to select a new avatar. This is great.

  However, once they have selected a new avatar picture, the new picture does not replace the old avatar picture that was there. This is confusing, as it makes it look like the app has done nothing. It only does something when you hit "Save", which is terrible UX.

  Instead, once they have selected a new avatar picture, it should replace the old avatar picture that was there and then set as the avatar URL when they hit "Save".
