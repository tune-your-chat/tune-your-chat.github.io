  Our identity server model has some shortcomings:
   * The trusted clique could be seen to act as an oligarchic point of control
   * The clique replicates all state over itself; unlike DNS root servers which partition the dataset
   * We don't have a way to map tokens to arbitrary 3rd party credentials unless one of our trusted clique validates said 3rd party credentials.  So otherwise you're stuck using @myapp-$uid:myapp.com style IDs, which is rather foul.

  Could something like bitauth help us on this?
