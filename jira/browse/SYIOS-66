  This issue appears when the app switches in online mode whereas a room is displayed (in offline).

  To reproduce:
  1 - cold start the app in offline mode
  2 - select an existing room
  3 - switch the app in online mode
  4- send a new message: this message is added as local echo (text in light grey) and it is not refreshed when message is delivered - NOK.

  Investigation has been already done: This issue is due to the fact that event listeners are broken for the displayed room.

  The issue concerns only the room displayed when the app becomes online.
  The user must select another room to restore the right display of rooms.

  body: This issue is blocked by SYIOS-62. Indeed we need change in MXSession API in order to be able to relaunch initial sync without restarting mxSession.
