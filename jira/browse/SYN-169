  A huge driver to remind people that Matrix exists would be to send them an opt-out weekly digest email or similar of notifications (and email notifications when people invite them).  I'm thinking a weekly mail saying "You missed 245 messages on #matrix:matrix.org.. 126 on #matrix-dev:matrix.org; click here to unsubscribe"... and then realtime updates to tell you whenever someone's trying to PM you.

  Hopefully the utility of the updates would outweigh their spamminess - and I think it helped Facebook's uptakes loads (especially before push notifs were a thing).
