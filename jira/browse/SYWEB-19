  Needs some kind of form to let you start a new chat with an arbitrary ID - e.g. start a convo with @god:matrix.org even if you're not in any of the same channels as him.

  It should support 3PIDs as well as matrix IDs - and if the email address isn't known, it should cough up a mailto: URL to encourage you to mail the person to get involved in Matrix.
