  After not looking at the push notification section of the web client for months, then going into it for the second time, I was surprised at how unintuitive the play/pause icons are. It's really hard to see at a glance if a notification is on or off.

  I think it would be better to have an on/off toggle rather than play/pause like so:
  {code}
  +---------------+
  | ON XX____ OFF | Notify me when people join or leave rooms
  +---------------+
  {code}
  Coupled with colour coding (e.g. green/red) it makes it easier to see at a glance which things are active, without trying to scan down a list of teeny tiny icons like we have to currently.
