  Currently we handle historical room metadata (e.g. topic changes) by supplying an event which has a prev_content key to show the previous value of said metadata.  This means that as the user paginates back through history of a room, they know what the current value should be. 

  However, this doesn't allow arbitrary querying of historical state if you're not paginating - e.g. when doing a search on room history.  It also is a bit inefficient, as it doubles the size of these events.

  Do we need a separate API for querying the room metadata state at a given version token?
