  There was a CI test failure on commit https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/693d0b8f4562d79ca00e05ce0cfd2d8c7b175b59 which could only be reproduced on the CI box when coverage was turned on. It was 100% reproducible, on that box only. The next commit "fixed" it. This issue is here to serve as a marker for a known test race.

  The test fails with:
  {code}
  [ERROR]
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  Failure: exceptions.Exception: 22 Oopsie

  tests.test_state.StateTestCase.test_power_level_succeed
  {code}

  It turns out that this exception is thrown *in another test*: {{tests/test_distributor.py:test_signal_catch_no_suppress}}. Somehow, this exception is being thrown in a subsequent test sometimes.
