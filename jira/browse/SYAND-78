summary: Start on boot

  It would be great if the Android client started automatically on boot. As it stands I have to remember to start it every time my devices boot, which makes it feel a bit less polished and integrated. I often forget to do this for days, which isn't an issue with other messaging apps I run.

  Thanks.

    GCM Management
    The application automatically starts on boot when a notification is received.

    It would be nice if this feature wasn't tied to GCM, since it isn't immediately obvious that the client requires it. I.e. should I not wish to use GCM, maybe because my phone doesn't have Google apps running on it, I should still be able to have the client start on boot and not have to remember to restart it every time. Almost every messaging app I run has this ability.

    Thanks.
