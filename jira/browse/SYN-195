description: "Whenever I upgrade arasphere.net's server and restart it, the first message I send into #matrix:matrix.org is never echoed or persisted by matrix.org itself.  Other servers (e.g. jki.re) seem to see it though.  I reproduced this yesterday, resulting in the following convo:\n\nMatthew: \"erik: are you familiar with the bug where the first message sent after restarting a federated server seems to disappear into the void?\t\n e.g. \"test\" there (after restarting arasphere)\t\n i'm not sure i've filed it; but it's consistent for arasphere->matrix.org\t\n\nErik: I see a \"test\"\t(but only on jki.re)\n\nAlso, relatedly? @matthew:arasphere.net isn't appearing in the membership list for #matrix:matrix.org (on my matrix.org client) at all"
