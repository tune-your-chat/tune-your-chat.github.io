<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3192">MSC3192: Batch state endpoint</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC defines an endpoint to send lots of state (max 50 at once) into a room in one go. This sounds useful for all sorts of tasks, and it's a wonder that it hasn't come up before.</p>
<p>If that sounds like an endpoint you'd like to go, give feedback on the MSC linked above!</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Work to use Matrix as the standard for interoperable messaging at the IETF is continuing in full stride. At <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/">IETF 117</a> (July 22nd - 28th, 2023) we'll be talking about the precise requirements of an interoperable protocol, and encouraging Matrix be that protocol. Linearized Matrix is our proposal for the room model, with more updates expected in the coming days ahead of the submission deadline, meanwhile yours truly is working on using MSC1767 Extensible Events for a content format. Watch this space for updates leading up to IETF 117 🙂</p>
<p>We're also well on track to test interoperability of different Linearized Matrix implementations at the Hackathon - get in touch with us via the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if you're working on such an implementation so we can coordinate details. It's not too late to get started either; Linearized Matrix itself is relatively simple to implement compared to the full capability of Matrix, by design.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3903">MSC3903: X25519 Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral for establishing secure channel between two Matrix clients</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC provides a means of establishing a trusted, secure communications channel across a potentially untrusted network. Subsequent MSCs could then use this channel to transfer details such as login tokens or key backup credentials in the context of setting up a new Matrix device. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906">MSC3906</a> is one proposal that takes advantage of this.</p>
<p>This is just one piece of work building on the tree of MSCs supporting the shift of authentication in Matrix from home-brewed to OIDC. See <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">https://areweoidcyet.com/</a> for more details on that effort.</p>

            <p>Libera Chat recently <a href="https://libera.chat/news/matrix-deportalling">announced their decision to opt-out of portalled rooms</a>
from the Libera.Chat bridge instance hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation
(<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/deportalling-libera-chat/">a decision we regret but respect</a>).
<strong>This means that for the bridge to keep working, all of your portalled rooms
need to be turned into plumbed rooms before July 31st</strong>. All of this might be a
bit obscure, so let’s walk together through these concepts and give you the
tools to make sure the bridge keeps working for you.</p>

            <p>On Monday 3rd July, the Libera.Chat IRC network shared that <a href="https://libera.chat/news/matrix-deportalling">they would no longer accept portalled rooms over the Matrix.org &lt;&gt; Libera.Chat bridge</a>.
This change will come into effect between 25th July and 31st July.</p>
<p>We respect the decision but also recognise that this will be disruptive for
matrix.org users accessing IRC over the bridge.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, if you currently use matrix.org as a bouncer into Libera.Chat this will no longer be possible unless the admin of every room you inhabit is willing
to reconfigure the room for plumbing.</p>
<p>This post explains the situation as seen from the matrix.org side, what it means for matrix.org users and what to do next.</p>

            <p>We launched the Matrix Public Archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULbvBIwiGEI">publicly on June 2nd, 2023</a>.
We decided to take it down on Sunday, June 25th out of precaution after a
member of OFTC staff warned us that the archive made the content of two OFTC IRC
channels bridged to Matrix available on the Internet.</p>
<p>After investigating the issue, we determined that the Matrix Public Archive's
behaviour was expected for these channels, given an IRC chanop had
<strong>explicitly</strong> configured the Matrix side of the rooms to be world-readable.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how room visibility works in vanilla Matrix, how it works with
bridges, and what are the next steps.</p>

            <p>We were already proud to <a href="/blog/2021/07/21/germany-s-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix/">announce</a>
that the national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system in
Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>) had selected Matrix as the open standard
on which to base all its interoperable instant messaging standard, back in 2021.</p>
<p>We are now delighted to let the world know that they are doubling down on
sovereignty and sustainability: gematik is the first organisation of the public
sector to join the Matrix.org Foundation as a Silver member.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-in-the-public-sector">Collaboration in the public sector</h2>
<p>Our friends at the <a href="https://fsfe.org">FSFE</a> have been calling for software used
in public services to be free software in their
<a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/openletter/">Public Money Public Code campaign</a>. As
advocates of open standards and an open source project ourselves, this is
something we can get behind.</p>
<p>Software development can be an impenetrable world for people who don’t work in
the field. It can sometimes be difficult for people outside of our industry to
understand the importance of bitrotting and refactoring. One very unfortunate
effect of this is that <strong>new features are easy to fund because they feel very
tangible, but the most critical housekeeping work is not as appealing</strong>.</p>
<p>Yet, without regular refactoring to clean things up, it gets increasingly costly
and difficult to add new features. <strong>Counterintuitively, spending money on “the
boring tasks” is the most efficient use of money</strong>: without it the technical
stack would become either obsolete, bloated, or both, and it would be much more
costly to move to something else or maintain an in-house fork.</p>
<p>We’re very happy gematik is doing the right thing by supporting the technical
stack it builds TI-Messenger on. By supporting the Matrix.org Foundation,
gematik contributes to the sustainability of the protocol powering the
communications of the German healthcare system… but not exclusively.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-costs-across-public-services-and-with-the-private-sector">Sharing costs across public services, and with the private sector</h2>
<p>Matrix is an open standard, which means not only everyone can use it: when
someone contributes to Matrix, everyone benefits from it. This makes Matrix
particularly interesting for the public sector: if the German healthcare
contributes to Matrix, the <a href="https://element.io/case-studies/bundeswehr">German Armed Forces</a>
benefit from it, and the other way around. <strong>It allows both to contribute less
of their budget, instead of contributing each to an entirely different
product.</strong> The German Federal Ministry of Defence already actively contributes
to Matrix development and funding via its public IT services provider BWI GmbH,
who relies on Element’s consulting services to develop their own Matrix-based
messenger.</p>
<p>But Matrix being open source, it also allows the public and private sector to
share the costs of maintenance <em>by design</em>. <strong>The public sector benefits from
the contributions of the private sector to Matrix, and the opposite is true as
well.</strong></p>
<p>The Foundation plays a critical technical <em>and social</em> role in this system: it
centralises and curates contributions to the protocol so it remains unbiased,
coherent, and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-a-beginning">This is just a beginning</h2>
<p>We’re extremely happy to welcome the first public sector organisation in the
Matrix.org Foundation! Given how popular Matrix is among governments and the
public sector in general, we know this is just a beginning: it would be
illogical to deploy any solution at a large scale without contributing to its
sustainability.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an organisation from the public or the private sector, looking to
cut costs down by building on a common, standard and reliable foundation, you
can <a href="https://matrix.org/support/">support Matrix</a> and
<a href="https://matrix.org/membership/">join the Foundation</a> today.</p>

            <p>We're proud to announce <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> is the first member to join
the Foundation! Beeper is a universal chat app, built on top of Matrix. Beeper
is strongly committing to support Matrix by becoming the first member in the
Gold tier as well.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-is-a-strategic-choice">Matrix is a strategic choice</h2>
<p>Beeper allows you to connect accounts from up to 15 different chat platforms to
get a unified inbox in a single app. The core business of Beeper is to provide a
polished app and service to their users. Beeper is built upon Matrix: behind the
scenes, a Beeper account is a Matrix account on the Beeper homeserver, and the
company hosts bridges for its users. The experience is completely transparent
for them.</p>
<p>Matrix was an obvious choice in Beeper's stack because of its interoperable
nature. <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/">Bridges</a> are the core of
Beeper's business: they are the most active bridges maintainer of the Matrix
ecosystem, and most of them are open source too. It makes a lot of sense for
Beeper to build on top of Matrix so they don't have to reinvent the wheel:
homeservers exist, the AppService API that allows them to create bridges exists,
and maintaining an in-house solution for this all would cost more than their
contribution to Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix also solves the difficult problem of End-to-Bridge Encryption: it allows
bridges to decrypt messages from a third party platform like WhatsApp and
re-encrypt it for Matrix users. This makes the homeserver completely oblivious
to the content of the messages. It protects customers against passive leaks, and
the most privacy conscious ones can even <a href="https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager">self-host their bridges</a>
to get total control of the messages making it through.</p>
<h2 id="mission-aligned">Mission aligned</h2>
<p>Beyond the obvious business choice of relying on Matrix, Beeper and the
Foundation have a lot of values in common. The Foundation is fighting for
interoperability possible at a technical level… but it's also fighting to make
it possible at a legal and systemic level. We've been very vocal in the Digital
Markets Act discussions In Europe. Beeper's CEO Eric Migicovsky also took part
in the consultation launched by the EU in the hopes of opening up the walled
gardens of <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en#who-are-the-gatekeepers">Gatekeepers</a>.
The regulation change brought by the DMA will accelerate the adoption of
interoperability across the board, bringing the tools to make it sustainable and
reliable, which is a direct business enabler for Beeper.</p>
<h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>
<p>We once again welcome Beeper and congratulate them for being the first member to
support the stack they rely on! As for organisations who depend on Matrix: we
still need your support to make Matrix sustainable.</p>
<p>Join us in our mission to make Matrix the ubiquitous foundation for respectful
products and services, <a href="https://matrix.org/membership">become a member today</a>!</p>

            <p>We shared back in December how we wanted to find a way for people and
organisations to support Matrix in a more impactful manner. We wanted it to also
enable the Foundation to be more autonomous and more powerful in growing the
ecosystem. Well the day has come: the Foundation is now able to formally accept
members!</p>
<p>So what is a member of the Matrix.org Foundation? It's an organisation or
individual who financially supports the Foundation by paying a yearly membership
fee, and in return gets some influence in driving the direction of Matrix and
the Foundation's activities.</p>
<p>The key has been to create a balanced governance model, to make sure the
Foundation stays aligned with the <a href="https://matrix.org/about/#matrix-manifesto">Matrix manifesto</a>.
For this we've created a <a href="https://matrix.org/membership/">Governing Board</a> to
set the direction of the Foundation whilst the membership fees will fuel our
efforts to get us there.</p>
<p>So why become a member?</p>
<h2 id="a-common-durable-platform">A common, durable platform</h2>
<p>Matrix is an open protocol everyone can contribute to. However we believe that
to remain healthy, a protocol is better off having a single spec that needs to
be curated. The additions need to be debated, implemented in actual software,
and the rest of the specification needs to be adapted to the new changes. Such
curation and edition work take time and effort, but the benefits of it are
enormous.</p>
<p><strong>A curated protocol benefits individuals, digital rights activists, and
philanthropic investors who believe in the fundamental right to control and
privacy in online communication</strong>. As an open standard for real time
communications, Matrix brings the sovereignty, security and interoperability,
which are key to having full control over one's own communication. By
financially supporting the project, people who are aligned with our beliefs
allow us to keep fighting for our collective rights, be it by providing secure
software or persuading regulators to protect their citizens (such as our
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/03/15/the-dma-stakeholder-workshop-interoperability-between-messaging-services/">DMA promotion work</a>
or our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/19/how-the-u-ks-online-safety-bill-threatens-matrix">fight against the Online Safety Bill</a>).</p>
<p><strong>A curated protocol benefits profit-making companies building communication
products and services.</strong> Decentralisation is a hard problem. End-to-end
encryption is a hard problem. Decentralised end-to-end encrypted communications
are a very hard problem. Matrix is doing the heavy lifting in these areas so
companies can focus on building what they do best: creating great user
experiences on top of it. By financially supporting the project, organisations
building on Matrix rest assured it keeps evolving, being patched and staying
secure. In short it ensures Matrix remains a competitive advantage over other
products, at a fraction of what it would cost to maintain an in-house solution.</p>
<p><strong>A curated protocol benefits entire governments, and large parts of the public
sector</strong>, who have both adopted it widely. Public organisations can not only
benefit from a sovereign, secure and interoperable solution - they can also
ensure public money is spent for public good, not shareholder wealth. By joining
the Matrix Foundation, public sector entities contribute to the stability,
security and performance of Matrix. Investing into the project ensures that the
open standard that is supporting their healthcare, defence and public
administration continues to benefit from innovative open source software
development.</p>
<h2 id="stay-unbiased-vendor-neutral">Stay unbiased &amp; vendor neutral</h2>
<p>The Matrix manifesto hasn't changed. We still believe people should have full
control over their own communication, not be locked in silos, be able to
converse securely and privately, and that communication should be available to
everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard and global network.</p>
<p>The Foundation maintains the Spec, which formalises the behaviour expected from
the various software components of the Matrix ecosystem. We believe it's
important for both individuals using the protocol - and organisations building
products on top of it - to be part of the decision process when it comes to
shaping the evolution and features of Matrix. So we have designed membership
tiers catering for all budgets, and mapped the Governing Board representatives
evenly across the tiers.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team appointed by the Foundation's Guardians is particularly
vigilant against features which only benefit particular players, or are designed
to somehow cripple or fragment the open protocol and ecosystem in favour of
competitive advantage. As such it is a guardian of the neutrality of the
protocol, making sure it will serve the general public's interests and be a
solid base to build robust products on for commercial organisations.</p>
<h2 id="delivering-from-the-get-go">Delivering from the get go</h2>
<p>The Matrix.org Foundation wants to take a more active stance in supporting the
protocol. The Foundation needs to respond appropriately to the Governing Board's
recommendations. We are <a href="https://apply.workable.com/elementio/j/0D7080B8A1/">hiring a Managing Director</a>
who will be in charge of identifying and building programmes the Foundation can
deliver, obtaining funding for it, building a team and overseeing the delivery
with the approval and support of the Governing Board.</p>
<p>Such programmes could include an accreditation process, to give more visibility
and credibility to the organisations adopting Matrix seriously, organising more
Matrix events, to promote the standard and share experiences amongst the
community etc. Their mission will overall be to make the ecosystem thrive and
grow.</p>
<p>A Managing Director working full time will also allow us to increase the
Foundation's transparency by allowing it to report more often on such
programmes, independently from any vendor.</p>
<h2 id="going-where-we-re-expected-to">Going where we're expected to</h2>
<p>The Governing Board is the new compass of the Foundation: it refines the vision
of the Foundation and steers the Managing Director and Spec Core Team in the
right direction.</p>
<p>This gives the Governing Board a lot of power over the Foundation and Matrix,
so we've put in place several safeguards to ensure the Foundation remains
healthy.</p>
<p>For example, the Guardians remain the ultimate authority, should the Governing
Board take decisions against the interest of Matrix, and the Governing Board
cannot appoint or remove members of the Spec Core Team.</p>
<p>To ensure that the Governing Board is representative from every stakeholder in
the ecosystem, we've included both representatives from every membership levels,
including individuals, but also representatives of those who are rooted in its
day to day operations (i.e. the MD and the Spec Core Team), and of the
Guardians.</p>
<p>Since the Governing Board sets the direction for the Foundation, continuity is
important. Therefore, members of the Governing Board are serving for two years,
with yearly elections renewing only half of the board at once. This makes room
for fresh ideas without losing context of the previous decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, this membership scheme is also meant to formalise and better distribute
the relations of power in the Matrix ecosystem, to make it more independent of
specific vendors. We believe this is a major next step to make Matrix thrive,
and <a href="https://matrix.org/membership">welcome everyone to join us in our mission</a>.
