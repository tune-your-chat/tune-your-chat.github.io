  body: 'By @matthew:matrix.org: intelfx: I think Ive spotted a minor usability issue: if my HS has a downtime (and comes back afterwards), I dont see any messages which were sent during the downtime until someone sends a message _after_ the downtime. The latter apparently causes the HS to retrieve the missing vertices of the history graph (which is a very neat demonstration of the Matrix core functionality, btw!), but it would be good if a HS was able to "pull the current HEAD" off the room (speaking in terms of git) or something like that automatically when it comes back online.'
