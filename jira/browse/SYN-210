  [23:16]  <scounder> hmm anyone know if matrix allows people with similar interests to find each other in a conference room without actually knowing each other first?
  [23:18]  <Arathorn> hmm, there's nothing explicitly to support it
  [23:18]  <Arathorn> and our room listing mechanisms are pretty basic at the moment
  [23:18]  <Arathorn> but it'd certainly be interesting to support specifying more metadata about rooms than their topic, name and alias
  [23:19]  <Arathorn> to make that easier

  Aside from this, we need APIs for searching & paginating the public room listing, and exposing for search engines (and possibly aggregating across multiple homeservers)
