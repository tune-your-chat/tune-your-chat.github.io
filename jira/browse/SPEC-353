  There have been a few use cases where it would be useful if all (or most) of the users in a room agree on setting some room state before it takes effect - or where a proposal for room state might need to be moderated by an admin. For instance, all users in a room may need to opt in before history visibility rules are changed. Or users may propose a new avatar for the room which the admin can approve. There are some clear problems here (100% consensus breaks if even one user has gone awol), and avatars could be proposed in-band or OOB without needing dedicated protocol support for it, but it's an interesting idea
