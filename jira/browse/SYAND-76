  As a admin of a root I want to have to the ability to set an avatar image of a room.

  See SPEC-153.

  In the room overview (start page) the image should be shown on the left side, before the name of the room.
  In a room the avatar should be shown between the back arow and the name of the room. 
  Tipping on the image should give an admin the ability to change the avatar image.
