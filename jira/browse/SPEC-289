summary: User id comparisons should be case insensitive

  I'm seeing more and more disasters with people failing to identify users correctly due to case sensitive IDs.  For instance Amandine's business cards say @amandine:matrix.org whereas she's registered as @Amandine:matrix.org.

    If we want any level of flexibility for this lookup we need the HS to implement mapping from printed user-id to actual matrix ID.

    Unless we restrict the space of IDs to fit into ASCII then rigorously defining a case insensitive match is slightly painful.

    The current plan of action on this (as discussed IRL yesterday evening is):

     * Store IDs case-sensitively in the DB
     * Compare them case-sensitively in the code & protocol
     * Canonicalise them either at the origin client or origin HS by querying a lookup API on the destination HS (as per SPEC-62).  This adds a roundtrip, but it may be suppressable by combining with some other roundtrip.

    Open questions are:
     * Do you do the canonicalisation lookup from the origin client (yet another random thing to expect clients to remember to do, which they will never remember to)
     * Do you do the canonicalisation lookup from the origin HS?
     * Do you use a user alias->id (assuming user aliases were separated from underlying IDs) lookup to also perform the canonicalisation?
