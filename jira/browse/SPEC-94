  The {{gendoc.sh}} script is useful, but would be nicer if it were more generic
  (e.g. removing the {{scp}} line, modifying where it stores the html files, etc). As it stands, it feels very fragile and scary because it assumes certain folders exist e.g. {{workspace}} and it directly {{scp}} s to other machines, even if previous commands fail. Given this script *is available on Github*, we should really make this a genuinely useful tool to HTML-ise the docs.

  In addition, errors thrown by this script (from blobbing together disparate RSTs) are *extremely* useful to know, and would've caught:
   - https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commit/109c8a97
   - https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commit/62471348

  so I would like it if there was a Jenkins project setup to test just that: {{cat}} into a single RST then parse it and make sure there are 0 errors.

    There are now RST syntax checks being done by Jenkins.

    The {{gendoc.sh}} script has been split up into {{gendoc.py}} which does the {{cat}} and {{rst2html}} work, and {{matrix-org-gendoc.sh}} which has the perl specific guff for matrix.org
