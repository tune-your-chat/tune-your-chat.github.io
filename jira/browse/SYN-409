  Several people are reporting that they stop getting push.

  Observations from the field:

   * It starts working if they toggle push (ie. re-set the pusher)

  I have also found a user in the broken state and observed the following:

   * Restarting synapse fixes their push
   * Restarting synapse also causes messages sent in the interim to get pushed (the invite I sent previously that did not arrive came through after restarting synapse)

  Therefore I think this is caused by the event stream that the pusher uses failing.
