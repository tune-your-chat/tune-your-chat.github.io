  The most recent release of matrix-angular-sdk is too old to include a commit I recently made:

    bf51e25 Have installed_location() return the dirname of __file__, not file itself, so the caller doesn't have to os.path.dirname() it manually

  Having this in a release means that a comparable change can be made within synapse that would neaten up some details in the debian package.
