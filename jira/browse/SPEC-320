  We need a way to solve the global directory problem in Matrix of discovering what published rooms exist out there.

  Options include:
   1. Let users manually specify the server they're querying when browsing the room directory in their client.  (This was the conclusion when this was last discussed IRL, iirc)
   2. Let servers delegate /publicRooms through to other servers too - either cascading based on ones they know about, or based on a whitelist, or just a static list
   3. Expose /publicRooms via an SEO-friendly web interface and hope Google handle it for us (ugh, depends on Google)
   4. Shove it all into some kind of global data structure (DHT, etc), which we may need anyway in future for discovering distributed accounts.
