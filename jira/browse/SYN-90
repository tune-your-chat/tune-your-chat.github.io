    Running:
    {code}
    pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/develop
    {code}
    will install synapse. 

    Now we just to work out how to upload stuff to PyPI.

    A few nitpicks:

    1.) --process-dependency-links is deprecated pending removal
    2.) On some distributions, such as arch, python3 is the default - but synapse does not work on python3
    3.) While --user allows installing dependencies without impinging on the system as a whole, it may not be sufficient - in particular, system dependencies that are later upgraded or uninstalled may break synapse.

    The following command worked for me, and addresses all of the above issues:

    {code:sh}pip2.7 install --user --upgrade --ignore-installed https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/develop{code}

    The --upgrade argument causes pip to install the best version available to satisfy dependencies rather than making do with what may already be present, and --ignore-installed tells it to not rely on system modules even if they are the best available version. The result is that only a change of Python version or config can break it, which is considerably less likely.

    The command may also be abbreviated to:

    {code:sh}pip2.7 install --user -UI https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/develop{code}
