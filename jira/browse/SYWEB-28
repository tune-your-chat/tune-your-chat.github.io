summary: Ordering of users in a room memberlist should be by most recent activity in a room - not global presence activity

  I expect the ordering of users in a room to reflect who has been active most recently in a given room (which is admittedly different to most IRC clients, but I think it's a fun feature).  This is slightly hard to implement as we only track activity currently based on global presence state.

  However, the ordering is currently neither of these - offline users are ordered all over the place, and recently talking users often never move to the top of the list either.

    Members strange ordering has been fixed. Members needed to be sorted according to their absolute time of their last activity.
    Members who do not have last_active_time_ago value go at the end of the list. Such members are then sorted each other according to their presence state. Available first, offline last.

    However, the ordering requested by the ticket is not implemented since some data are missing

    So we currently order by the last globally active time?

    Presumably we could order by the last locally active time in the room - we just need to look at when we last saw an event from someone in the room?  (Modulo pagination problems)?

    Yes, it is ordered by the last globally active time. This is the information the presence API provides and this is what we wanted to show at first.

    We can change order as you described. The pagination problem could be fixed by the HS. 
    When we make a request to get the members list of a room, the server could provide the time when users have been active for the last time in this room.
