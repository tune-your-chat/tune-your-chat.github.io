  To reproduce:
   - In the Per-Word notifications section, add a new rule with * in the text input
   - Click on its delete button
  -> The deletion has no effect

  The webclient makes a wrong request for deleting the rule:
  bq. https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/api/v1/pushrules/global/content/undefined?access_token=...

  This is certainly due to rule_id that is missing for this rule when the HS responds to GET /pushRules/
