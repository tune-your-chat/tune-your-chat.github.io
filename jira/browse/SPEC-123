  We currently have no way of asking you server to blacklist groups of users from ever trying to contact you.  This is a pretty important abuse avoidance metric.

  Open questions include:
   * Per-user or per-group (need a generic way to manage lists of users then, but we kinda need that anyway)
   * Ignore invites, or all traffic from these users?
   * Can we build this into reputation analysis?

  The use case here is that someone invites you to a chat, either with a nasty name or nasty contents after you accept the invite, and you never want to see them again.
