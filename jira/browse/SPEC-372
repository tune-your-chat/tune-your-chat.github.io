description: |-
  If you opt to leave a room (or someone else kicks you), you receive an {{m.room.member}} event that sets your own {{membership}} state to {{leave}}. If someone cancels an invite on you before you joined, you get a membership state change to {{leave}}.

  The only way to distinguish these two cases is to examine the previous state, to see if it used to be {{invite}} or {{joined}}. However, the membership state event you receive over the event stream doesn't contain the previous state, it only contains the event ID the previous state was in. Since you're no longer a member of the room, you don't have the necessary permission to look at that state event to remind yourself what that state was.
