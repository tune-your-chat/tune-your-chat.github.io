  Meanwhile, implementing a flow for some mechanism like SCRAM for folks who can't speak TLS could be good - see https://twitter.com/HCornflower/status/697791409785450500

    If you want to avoid exposing the password on the wire, there are two ways
    One is to use a hashed challenge-response protocol. such as CHAP. As can be seen by the history of CHAP, this is very difficult to get right.
    It also means the password must be stored plaintext in the DB, which is a non-started.
    The other is to use an augmented PAKE, such as SRP or AugPAKE or SPAKE2 (which the IETF CFRG is working on)
    These do not expose the password on the wire or in the database
    Guest 4989: But more specifically, if what's sent over the wire is enough to log you in, and simply sending it is enough, it's "password equivalent", and has no security benefits over a password.
    (Well, the above holds so long as it's opaque and time-invariant - macaroons have advantages due to the fact that they aren't always valid, but during the validity period, the above holds)

    the XMPP folks prodded me proudly at their password-alternative login mechanism
    but i can't remember for the life of me what XEP it is
    ah, SCRAM
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-13.8.3
    [1] RFC 6120 - Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core

    <eternaleye>
    Matthew: Mm, SCRAM is a viable option, yeah
    But again, it's not simply hashing it before sending it over the wire - to get better-than-password security, you need either an interactive protocol, or asymmetric crypto (and sometimes both)
    Anyway, potentially of interest: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-spake2-03
    That's the augmented PAKE protocol I mentioned
    SPAKE2+ is the augmented one, SPAKE2 is symmetric (both sides have plaintext)
