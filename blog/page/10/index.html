<p>This last week the SCT has largely been preparing for the spec release happening on August 23rd, 2023 and working on getting some of the IETF/MIMI work into MSC shape. It's largely business as usual at the moment for the SCT :)</p>
<p>Matrix 1.9's planned work will be finalized on Monday as well, ahead of the Matrix 1.8 release on Wednesday. Please raise any MSCs or general feature areas to the SCT before Monday in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> for them to be considered. The SCT will have limited/no bandwidth to look at things not raised for consideration.</p>

<p>We have a release date planned for Matrix 1.8! We're looking at <strong>Wednesday, August 23rd, 2023</strong>, and tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/1614">issue #1614</a>. Currently the only release blocker is room version 11, which should land well in advance of August 23rd. If there's other things we should be considering please raise them ASAP in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>August 23rd also begins the Matrix 1.9 cycle where we'll be sticking to our MSC review plan more strongly. Stay tuned to TWIM for news on the exact MSCs/features we'll be looking at for that cycle, and let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if you think we should consider something in our planning.</p>
<p>The SCT has otherwise been thinking a lot about the MIMI working group at the IETF and how the protocol layering works there. About half of the SCT is going to take a break from MSC review over the next few weeks to ensure the protocol we're designing for MIMI will be fully compatible with Matrix - this will mean that some MSCs will move slower through FCP, sorry.</p>
<p>As always, if you have questions, concerns, complaints, etc then let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> 🙂</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals">https://spec.matrix.org/proposals</a>.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>No movement through the process on the surface for any MSCs according to the above chart, but some things have been happening! Other than the usual background hum of IETF work, conversations across many MSCs have been moving along. We also saw <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a> (Polls push notifications) have FCP proposed! The latter would stop a notification from being generated every time someone voted in a poll, which is <em>sorely needed</em>.</p>
<p>A reminder that in keeping with the spec's quarterly release schedule, Matrix v1.8 is due to release this month and Matrix v1.9 is due for November. We want to plan well ahead for the v1.9 release though, so if you would like to see anything in particular land in v1.9, please raise that concern in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Spec Core Team room</a>!</p>
<p>See <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!ewdjhNcPcEmYNKzlWp:t2l.io/$_uGDrp_ENNA-6VIUJWLSKwcNmGzB9pyN89h4VtYTeRk?via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io&amp;via=envs.net">this message</a> in the same room for more information including the currently planned v1.9 spec changes.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3797">Refine and clarify how presence works</a>!</p>
<p>This is a very old "MSC" (still on google docs), but it's come up and I've seen folks taking a look at revamping presence recently, so I figured it may be interesting to share.</p>
<p>The document lists a number of confusing behaviours that come with the current presence spec (at the time, though it hasn't moved much since then). There is also a bullet-point list of what a redesigned presence could look like.</p>
<p>Given the conversation on the GitHub issue, this document appears lost to time. But perhaps someone will find it useful today.</p>

            <p>Hi folks. As previously mentioned on <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/bridges-security-updates/">Monday</a>, we’re now disclosing the vulnerabilities patched for the IRC, Slack and Hookshot bridges. If you have not already done so, please ensure you are running the patched versions.</p>
<p>Today we are disclosing the 3 vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-bridge-doesn-t-verify-the-sub-parameter-of-an-openid-token-exchange-cve-2023-38691">matrix-appservice-bridge doesn't verify the sub parameter of an openId token exchange (CVE-2023-38691)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x">GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38691">CVE-2023-38691</a></p>
<p>The <code>POST /v1/exchange_openid</code> endpoint did not check that the servername part of the <code>sub</code> parameter (containing the user's <em>claimed</em> MXID) is the same as the servername we are talking to. This could allow a malicious actor to spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a <code>sub</code> parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.</p>
<p>This is now patched so that the server part of the sub / user ID is checked against the server used to make the request.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by a community member.</p>
<h2 id="irc-command-injection-via-admin-commands-containing-newlines-cve-2023-38690">IRC command injection via admin commands containing newlines (CVE-2023-38690)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3">GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38690">CVE-2023-38690</a></p>
<p>When the IRC bridge attempted to parse an admin command from a Matrix user, it would only split arguments by a literal space. For example, sending “!join #matrix\nfoobar” would treat the channel name as “#matrix\nfoobar”. This could then be exploited to inject any IRC command into the bridge to be run. Since the !join command first joins via the bridge bot user, it could be used to execute commands as the bridge bot.</p>
<p>This is now patched so that both the command handler is more strict about its arguments, as well as channel names being explicitly validated when provided by users.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a>.</p>
<h2 id="events-can-be-crafted-to-leak-parts-of-targeted-messages-from-other-bridged-rooms-cve-2023-38700">Events can be crafted to leak parts of targeted messages from other bridged rooms (CVE-2023-38700)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q">GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38700">CVE-2023-38700</a></p>
<p>The IRC bridge caches recent timeline messages in memory, so that when a reply is seen for a message it doesn’t need to request the event content from the homeserver. However the room ID was not validated when accessing this cache, so a malicious actor could craft a reply event in another room referencing any event ID (so long as it was still in the bridge cache) to trick the bridge into posting the message content into a bridged reply.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>We've been quite busy at IETF 117 this last week discussing MLS and MIMI in several contexts, meetings, and sessions. Overall things have moved pretty fast in the last week, but the short summary is we're working with MIMI to get (Linearized) Matrix used as the new-found "signalling layer". This layer delegates membership of the room to the crypto layer when the crypto layer (namely MLS) supports being used as such, and is responsible for enforcing all policies. Policies in the context of MIMI are things like join rules, history visibility, and power levels, but with an added twist: we're looking at supporting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in combination with power levels in MIMI, which should also bring RBAC to Matrix in the form of a currently-unwritten MSC.</p>
<p>All told, we've got several new documents to write and MSCs to draft, but we'll get there in time. The MIMI working group is expecting solutions in place by about September, so watch this space for more news as we progress. An architecture draft is also in progress on the MIMI side to further explain what all of these new layers mean. In the meantime, if you have questions then please visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">the matrix-spec room</a> on Matrix!</p>
<p>We're also looking for more Matrix 1.9 candidates. Currently we have just custom emoji and anything to do with MIMI on the agenda - if you'd like to add more, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team room</a> on Matrix.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3062">MSC3062: Bot verification</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC describes a method for verifying (cross-signing) the devices of a bot user, and how verification of that sort could be done. Obviously it wouldn't make much sense to verify emoji with a bot. Instead, this MSC suggests that the bot provide a URL to present to the user. If the URL appears trustworthy (those who would control this URL should also be in charge of this bot), then the user can choose to continue the verification.</p>
<p>The user's Matrix client would then make a request to the URL with details of the verification. If the server responds successfully, some cryptographic magic happens, and your client will consider the bot verified!</p>
<p>This is essentially tying a bot's verification with control of a domain's DNS, which I think is a smart way to do things. But you do need to watch out for those pesky UTF-8 control characters when asking the user to verify the URL!</p>

            <p>We have recently announced that <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/deportalling-libera-chat/">we will be honouring Libera Chat’s request</a> to turn off portalled rooms on the Libera.Chat bridge maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The changes were originally scheduled to be effective on 31st July. In the meantime, we posted <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/make-sure-libera-bridge-keeps-working/">instructions for people to turn their portalled rooms into plumbed ones</a> so the bridge keeps working for them.</p>
<p>Some stability issues on the bridge have prevented people from turning their portalled rooms into plumbed ones. We have been actively working on resolving those issues since the first reports and the situation is gradually improving. However, at this point, we do not believe the plumbed mode can be considered sufficiently stable yet.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week we have been preparing for IETF117, Matrix 1.8, Matrix 1.9, and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/a-giant-leap-with-mls/">Messaging Layer Security (MLS) for Matrix</a>. Most of our work on globally interoperable communications is ongoing through the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group at the IETF, and will be making significant strides in the coming days as we head to the IETF117 <a href="https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/117/hackathon#linearized-matrix">hackathon</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/">meetup</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last few months we've been working on a version of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix/">Linearized Matrix</a> which supports the simplicity of linear event history while being fully compatible with today's Matrix network, and while we think that the 03 draft we wrote up accomplishes a lot of this, there's further work to be done to make it cleaner and easier to use. We've also been writing implementations of it to prove the semantics (and find areas which need improvement), starting with our cleanroom <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server">eigen-server</a> TypeScript implementation and interoperating it with a branch of Synapse. During IETF117 we expect more implementations to sprout and have their interoperability tested - watch this space for updates on how that goes.</p>
<p>Aside from IETF117, we're continuing to look at the previously-selected Matrix 1.8 MSCs for release in mid-late August 2023. This might be slow over the next couple of weeks while half of us are at IETF117, but expect more forward progress when we get back. Matrix 1.9 is scheduled to be released sometime in November 2023, and a few months ago we said we were aiming to plan ahead for releases a bit more deliberately. Starting this week, we're accepting submissions for ideas and specific MSCs which need our attention in Matrix 1.9. If you have an MSC (current or future) which will need Spec Core Team (SCT) attention between August 2023 and November 2023, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a> room. Once Matrix 1.8 is released (exact date TBD) we will have limited availability to add things to the Matrix 1.9 target - please raise your MSCs &amp; themes as soon as possible. The current set of MSCs up for consideration can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88">SCT Intake Board</a>.</p>
<p>If you've made it this far in our weekly update, congratulations, and thank you. We expect things will rapidly start to happen with IETF117 kicking off tomorrow (July 22, 2023), and we will do our best to keep folks updated. Next week's TWIM in particular will have a post-IETF117 debrief for your reading enjoyment :)</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or concerns about what we're working on, visit the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a> and let us know. We can't promise a prompt reply (particularly during IETF117), but we will take a look when we can.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3105">MSC3105: Previewing UIA flows</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC addresses a shortcoming in the current <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api">User-Interactive Authentication</a> (UIA) mechanism where attempting to deduce the required authentication flows for an action will result in that action being carried out if it turns out no flows were required. This makes it tricky for a client to present a "are you sure you want to do X?" as a final step in completing an action that requires authentication.</p>
<p>The proposals aims to allow an OPTIONS pre-flight HTTP request to the same endpoint in order to retrieve the flows necessary, without actually carrying out the action. The proposal does note that using OPTIONS for this case is a bit non-standard though, and some clients may treat the typical <code>401</code> error code returned during User-Interactive Auth as a fatal error.</p>
<p>While this does address a flaw in the UIA system, it's worth noting that many other flaws exist! Matrix is planning to move over to an OpenID Connect-based authentication system in the not too distant future, which will likely have far fewer edge cases than our traditional, home-grown one. You can visit <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">https://areweoidcyet.com/</a> for more information and to track the current progress on that front.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Given our commitment to open standards and interoperability, we’re delighted to see MLS be ratified by the IETF as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420">RFC9420</a>.</p>
<p>MLS is a new encryption standard defined by the IETF, the standards body that maintains much of what makes the internet work. In the same way that Transport Layer Security (TLS, another IETF standard) defines the way to provide encryption between users and servers, or between two different servers, MLS provides a standard way for users of a messaging service to communicate securely without servers being able to eavesdrop on their conversations.</p>
