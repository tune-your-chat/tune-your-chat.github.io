  If you go to settings and keep hammering on the account in order to edit its settings, it can take a while to respond as it talks to the network. When it returns, all the taps fire one after another and you get pushed deep onto a stack of settings pages. We should have a spinner whilst it's loading and collapse the transitions into 1.
