  -1. Avatar updates are inconsistent - they seem to take effect globally (which /might/ be the correct behaviour?), other than if one is not set at all, when it then appears historically blank.  Either we should keep them historically accurate or globally in sync.-

  2. Updating avatar & displayname at the same time results in two "displayname updated" notifications.

    #1 : I vote for historically accurate.

    #2 : Reproduced locally. The events which are sent down when this happens has both {{avatar_url}} and {{displayname}} changing. The order of the checks means that {{displayname}} has priority if both have changed, so you never see the avatar URL change.
