summary: Events aren't synchronized across federated servers before users join

  As an application service, I create a room, inviting a user, and then immediately send a "m.call.invite" event to try to set up the call.  I don't wait for the user to join.

  If the user is on the same home server, they are notified of the event when they join the room.

  If the user is on a different home server, they are not notified, and the event is dropped.

  If I wait for the user to join before I send the "m.call.invite" event, it is always delivered correctly.
