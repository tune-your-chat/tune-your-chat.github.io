summary: 'SDK: Consider removing MXEventDirectionSync'

  With the use of v2 sync, ALL events received from /sync are notified as MXEventDirectionForwards. MXEventDirectionSync is no more used
  Do we need to fix that? Or is it better to remove the concept of informing sdk users about events coming while starting or resuming the session?

  The js and android SDK does not have such concept.
  The main issue if we remove it is that it will break a certain amount of SDK tests.

  This issue is showed by the failure of tests:
  - testListenerForAllLiveEvents
  - testListenerForSyncEvents
