  It took me several read-throughs of the client-server spec to figure out that the "Signing Events" section applies to the client-server *and* server-server APIs, and that some knowledge of the server-server API is needed to make any sense of it.

  Since I've been working with the spec and the JSON Schema files from matrix-doc side by side, I wondered for quite a while why the client-server spec was mentioning all these keys not represented in any of the JSON Schema files. The explanation and example JSON shown in the client-server spec include many keys that are not otherwise mentioned in the client-server spec. A good example is the list of non-essential keys in section 4.8.3 (1.9.3 on the master branch of matrix-doc). (I reference it by number because it has the same title as the parent section 4.8 (1.9 on master), which is also unfortunate. Perhaps the two could be distinguished better?)

  I think the spec would be much easier to understand if the section on signatures was extracted into an appendix and pointed to whenever relevant in the client-server and server-server specs. As an appendix, it will probably need a new intro or some changes in wording to clarify that it's relevant to both APIs, and to be explicit about which parts are exclusive to one API or the other.

    It's worse than that, in fact! This shouldn't be *any* concern to the client-server API at all, and is purely a server-server concern.

    I've put together a PR which moves it there and cleans up the language around this where it's unclear.

    Sorry again for the hassle!
