  When designing the AS API (somewhere in the guts of https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/5 or an associated etherpad) Kegan and I discussed the idea of homeservers being able to advertise the capabilities of the ASes they have configured - especially if those ASes can act as a gateway to another network.  This in turn could be useful for clients to be able to 'do the right thing' automatically if asked to join a foreign URI, assuming they know what servers are available.

  This might involve advertising capabilities via well-known URIs (SPEC-121), tracking how URI->MXIDs are converted (SPEC-124), or the stuff which is meant to advertise what URIs a given room is bridged to (SPEC-131).
