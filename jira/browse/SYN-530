  Tor runs his own HS.  Whenever he restarts ivarbot (connected to it), his other clients receive ~1000 presence events: snippets of convo below:

  <Tor> Something strange is happening here on my matrix-client
  whenever I restart ivarbot, my other clients on the same server gets a 1000-entry eventstream with a bunch of presence messages
  and many of them aren't even unique
  debug output of json: https://xt.gg/ss/2015-11-29_13-20-12.png

  it comes in 3 chunks I think
  3 different event responses
  first one is almost all verkstad, but not quite
  trying to load one of the URLs up in firefox for inspecting and it's complaining about invalid json, but it loads fine in jq.. so I'm still investigating
  https://xt.gg/ss/2015-11-29_13-45-53.png

  so the invalid json is error on my part
  but why restarting one client resulsts in over 100k json presence events is still weird

    <Tor> "remember I told you about that account that is not on any matrix.org rooms? Now I restarted ivarbot, which means full login+initialsync on that client. And now my bob-client got a presence updated with exactly 1000 entries in it. With most of them being offline
    1000:
      type: m.presence
      content:
        presence: offline
      sender: @leon:matrix.org"
