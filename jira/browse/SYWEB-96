  If we expect anyone to start building Matrix support into their existing apps, we need to provide mobile & web SDKs - the feedback was comprehensive from the TC Disrupt hackathon, at least.  APIs alone aren't good enough - people want something they can drop in and skin with a few lines of code.

  We should get a plan together here before the London TC Disrupt event on Oct 16-18.
