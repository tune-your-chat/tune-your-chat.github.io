  No further information on this yet, but I'm definitely getting some messages arrive and then disappear again. Just now, Matthew typed a bunch of messages, then the penultimate one of the batch disappeared at some point after it had arrived. Refreshing the page makes the message appear in the right place. I can't find it anywhere else on the page so I don't think it's been reordered.

  No useful information in the console log. Develop webclient connected to matrix.org.

  body: I've just had this happen again in Matrix HQ. It could have been that a new message arriving from Matthew ("sorry, i thought this was desktop chrome") somehow caused the preceding one ("* Matthew bugs it") to disappear instead.
