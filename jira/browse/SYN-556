  In certain situations[1] synapse can make an outbound federation request to an endpoint called {{/get_missing_events}}. A typical request looks like

  {noformat}
  Received request:
    POST /_matrix/federation/v1/get_missing_events/!ssTibPPiaXVVxszhMf:localhost:8001 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: X-Matrix origin=localhost:8001,key="ed25519:auto",sig="sCRTGESmzbO1qL9KTAeqbAhTk/mcOCXyD1CGNJhMsQr/07TSuIvOwxxKIzGZ2hpOu6ieYZhXlZrT2dMr2SuPBw"
    Host: localhost:38038
    User-Agent: Synapse/0.12.0-rc2 (b=develop,10f82b4)
    Content-Length: 106
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {"earliest_events":["$0:localhost:38038"],"latest_events":["$2:localhost:38038"],"limit":10,"min_depth":1}
  {noformat}

  This endpoint isn't at all specified, but this isn't the subject of this bug. This request is a {{POST}} whose body lacks an {{origin}} field. The federation spec says all {{POST}} bodies must have one, and this will be checked against the Auth header. In the above scenario, the federation server built into sytest rejects it immediately with

  {noformat}
  Sending response to /_matrix/federation/v1/get_missing_events/!ssTibPPiaXVVxszhMf:localhost:8001:
    403 Forbidden
    Content-Length: 94
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {"error":"'origin' in Authorization header does not match content","errcode":"M_UNAUTHORIZED"}
  {noformat}

  body: Actually on a closer inspection, it's OK to lack an {{origin}} field entirely. The auth check just wants to ensure that if there's a field, it matches the one in the header.
