  My notes from talking to Mjark yesterday:
  * Rules that we apply to check whether things aren't valid.  Too loose, we risk spoofing - too tight, we risk DoS (perhaps)

  A main question: should you reject stuff which is included in a transaction from a server, but isn't originally from that server, and is invalid?  Answer: probably. However you need to check you can't engineer a state where a malicious server encourages a legitimate server to accept an invalid message.
