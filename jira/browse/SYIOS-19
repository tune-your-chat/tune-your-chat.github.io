  The iOS app is alas almost unusable day-to-day currently because it doesn't cache any events at all clientside, and meanwhile initialSync and roomInitialSync take *way* too long to respond on the current synapse implementation, especially when synapse is being overloaded.

  Whilst this will get a bit better shortly with erik's performance improvements, it's critical that we cache the events locally.

  I don't care if this happens via a proper persistent coredata mxstore or something blunter and less sophisticated (the in-memory mxstore combined with blunt datastructure dumping at close/launch), but i think this is the top priority on the usability of the iOS app now.

    Console now uses MXFileStore, a store based on MXMemoryStore.
    It bumps MXMemoryStore data into the file system. At app launch, it rebuilds MXMemoryStore data from the stored files.
