  Problems to solve:

  1) Showing name / topic / alias of a room you've been invited to before you join
  2) Showing name / topic / alias of a public room before you join it
  3) Showing name / topic / alias of a private room before you request admission

  If we have this, there is a question of whether the recommended user experience for clients involves showing them this information when they try to join a room before the client actually attempts to join so they can back out if it's not actually what they wanted, or whether the client just joins anyway and assumes they'll leave if it wasn't what they expected.
