  I built a SIP/Matrix gateway.  For carrier-grade SIP, we want to avoid single points of failure.  How should a fault-tolerant SIP/Matrix gateway connect to Matrix?

  It's possible to build an application service using an active/backup fault-tolerance architecture, where only one of the pair is connected into Matrix at a time (or both are connected but only one processes events).

  I can't currently see a way of building an application service using a clustered architecture where many servers are all active but only a subset of these are required for capacity.  Each instance in the cluster could connect to Matrix, but then events would be duplicated - we only need each event to be delivered to the cluster once.

  The SIP approach (using multiple SRV records, one pointing to each host in the cluster) is outlined in RFC 3263.  An alternative might be to allow application services to specify a "group" they're joining when they register.
