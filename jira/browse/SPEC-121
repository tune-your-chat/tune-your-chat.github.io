description: |-
  We have several reasons why we might want to use .well-known URIs to discover API endpoints:

   * Clients which can't query SRV records (e.g. webclients trying to discover the C-S API for a given user ID's domain)
   * Admins who don't want to use the /_matrix convention, and adhere to  RFC5785 instead
   * Admins who can't create SRV records
   * Dynamic .well-known URIs to help discover nomadic homeservers

  See also SYWEB-224 and SYN-167

  We should just get on and do it.  Unsure whether SRV should trump .well-known URIs or not for server-server traffic.
