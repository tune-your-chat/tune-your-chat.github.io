    Do we make this an option, or do we just do it everywhere?
    I can see the value of keeping a public room list you can get without an access token, maybe rooms that are neither peekable or joinable by guests don't appear unless you give an access token? I think I'd prefer to have separate endpoints because getting a partial roomlist if your access token has expired sounds like the way madness lies. I think I would rather have endpoints that either work all the time or only when you have a valid login.
